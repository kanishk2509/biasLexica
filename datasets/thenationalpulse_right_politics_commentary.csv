0,Politics,Tennessee Became China’s Most Dependent U.S. State Following Bill Hagerty’s Tenure As Economy Chief,"Senate hopeful Bill Hagerty’s stint as Tennessee’s Department of Economic & Community Development Commissioner ended with the Volunteer State becoming the “most dependent state in America for trade with China”.In addition to policies Hagerty advocated for at the expense of American workers, his first-choice candidate in the 2016 Republican primary was Jeb Bush.The choice wasn’t off-brand for Hagerty, given his previous work with establishment presidents and hopefuls including George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain. And even after Jeb’s candidacy flamed out, he shifted to supporting pro-amnesty Marco Rubio, only eventually backing Donald Trump when he secured the Republican nomination.Appointed by ‘NeverTrumper’ Gov. Bill Haslam to lead the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) in 2011, Hagerty began pushing for Tennessee companies to expand to global markets. In the years following, however, such hopes never materialized but left Tennessee with a massive trade deficit and ensuing job loss.Hagerty’s boss Haslam said, “the best thing for the party would have been for [Trump] to step aside.”Under Hagerty’s leadership, the ECD spearheaded a “Medical Trade Mission” to China and South Korea.“The group will visit Beijing, China and Seoul, South Korea where they will attend meetings arranged by the U.S. Commercial Service. The mission participants will also travel to Shenzhen, China to attend the China International Medical Equipment Fair, the largest exhibition of medical equipment and related products and services in the Asia-Pacific region,” the press release described.While the motives behind the trip – ostensibly to invite Chinese buyers to view Tennessee as a viable source for goods – could have boosted business profits, Hagerty’s initiatives only increased the state’s dependence on China.Just a year after Hagerty’s tenure and plans came to an end at the ECD, Tennessee was named as the “most dependent state in America for trade with China” and a “top China trader”.While candidate Trump was making the case that the United States was “upside down” in trade with the United States, Haslam and Hagerty were increasing this deficit:The Volunteer State imported $23.7 billion of products from China last year, compared with exports to China from Tennessee of $2.2 billion. Such trade represents 7.9 percent of Tennessee’s gross domestic product, more than any other state in the country, [Steve] Livingston, [a professor of political science who studies international trade and publishes Global Commerce at Middle Tennessee State University] said.Chinese imports were even greater at $27 billion into Tennessee in 2015, according to government figures.China is a major supplier of electronic components used to make cellphones, printers and computers in Tennessee, Livingston said.China also is among Tennessee’s top 10 states for the level of foreign direct investment in the state with 14 Chinese companies investing more than $457.7 million in Tennessee facilities.Historically, neo-liberal economic policies have lauded China buying up American companies and owning American jobs like this. Referring to it euphemistically as “foreign direct investment”.In reality, it’s selling out the nation to the Chinese Communist Party.This resulted in trade deficits, a catalyst in driving American job loss, despite a trickle of a few hundred “new jobs” as a sop to U.S. nationalists.Dependence on China also leaves the quality and availability of products American consumers rely on in the hands of a communist country intent on overtaking the United States as a global power.While Hagerty’s actions alone weren’t responsible for wide-scale outsourcing and dependency on China, it certainly seems like he helped lay the groundwork for such trade deficits.Recently, Hagerty has attempted to convince voters that he is “pro Trump”. Conveniently timed for his own political campaign for Senate.But as The National Pulse has previously reported, Hagerty has staffed up his 2020 Senatorial campaign staff with establishment mainstays: his top staffer and fundraiser has a long history of working for Never Trumpers, Democrats, and consults with a controversial EB-5 immigration firm, effectively selling American citizenship.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/hagerty-china-tennessee-most-dependent/
1,Politics,REVEALED: China’s Plan to Censor The Whole Internet.,"The genius of the internet has always been its openness: anyone with a smartphone or a laptop can take part in a worldwide conversation. For authoritarian regimes, however, that very openness is instead a problem to be solved. China’s plan could lock down the internet forever.At the heart of the internet is a communications protocol called TCP/IP. The creators of TCP/IP in the 1970s could never have imagined that it would someday form the backbone for nearly all commerce and social discourse by the year 2020. That backbone is beginning to show its age as millions of new smartphones and smart devices are added to the network every year. Industry giants are each offering their own ideas on creating a new structure for the world wide web.Chinese state-owned technology firm Huawei recently unveiled their own proposal to replace TCP/IP. Called New IP, this standard is designed to make communication more efficient, allowing for faster internet connections for smartphones and web-connected devices such as light bulbs and self-driving cars.But the new proposal has a darker side.The first red flag in the New IP proposal is a built-in kill switch that can be used to cut off websites or users that are engaging in bad behavior.While that might sound like good news in a world of spammers, scammers, and hackers, authoritarian regimes such as China would doubtlessly use it to shut down political dissidents, Hong Kong democracy protestors, or even foreign activists that the Chinese Communist Party consider a threat to their total control of information.The openness of the internet is in large part due to its decentralized nature. Today, no one person or group can totally control what you see or do not see on the web.On the other hand, China has worked hard to control the internet within their borders.They created the so-called “Great Firewall of China,” a system of legal and technological barriers within their borders that prevents citizens from learning anything not approved by the CCP.For example, a normal image search for “Tiananmen Square” returns the famous picture of a man defiantly facing down a line of tanks as pro-democracy protests were brutally crushed by the Chinese communist regime.The same search performed on Chinese-owned search engine Baidu, however, returns pictures of the beautiful architecture of the Square, with no tanks or dissidents to be found.New IP would build a Great Firewall into the very structure of the internet itself.Another troubling aspect of New IP is its built-in authentication system.The internet up until now has allowed for tremendous anonymity and privacy. An activist or dissident can put up a website or comment on social media without revealing their true name or location. Anonymity and privacy have always been important for democracy – recall that Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay originally published the Federalist Papers under a pseudonym.Totalitarian regimes, however, have long fought against this kind of safety for dissidents.Five years ago, China began forcing internet users within their country to register their real names before being allowed to use social media. China also has a pervasive “social credit score” system that can punish people who engage in politically incorrect discourse by barring them from travel or conducting business.While most Americans rightly recoil at these examples of communist tyranny, some in the west think that China is leading the way.Last month, the Atlantic magazine published a piece urging America to adopt the worst of Chinese-style censorship of the internet. Law professors Jack Goldsmith and Andrew Keane Woods wrote, “In the great debate of the past two decades about freedom versus control of the network, China was largely right and the United States was largely wrong. Significant monitoring and speech control are inevitable components of a mature and flourishing internet, and governments must play a large role in these practices to ensure that the internet is compatible with a society’s norms and values.”If the world adopts the new internet backbone proposed by Huawei, Chinese-style censorship will inevitably spread through the west. American companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter have already censored dissenting voices.Web hosts and payment processors have blacklisted businesses such as gun sellers, all but banning them from the internet. Thus far, the nature of the internet has prevented governments from simply turning off unapproved voices, but New IP could change that.Huawei – the CCP-linked telecommunications giant – denies there is anything nefarious about the New IP proposal.According CEO Eric Xu, “…for many years, IP technology has not kept up with the needs of the industrial Internet, particularly in terms of low latency and security… These activities are not as complicated or politically driven as some people think, and the technical topic being researched should not be politicized.”But only fools and paid propagandists take the Chinese communist regime at their word.While Huawei claims to be independent, many industry experts believe the company is inextricably linked to the Chinese Communist Party. Timothy Heath, a security analyst with the RAND Corporation, explained: “the Chinese state has the authority to demand tech companies like Huawei turn over useful information or provide access to the communications and technologies owned and sold by Huawei.”The CCP has demonstrated their desire and willingness to censor the web for their own citizens as well as use it as a weapon against other nations. Allowing China to build the next generation of the internet is a dangerous proposition.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/revealed-chinas-plan-to-censor-the-whole-internet/
2,Politics,Chinese State Media Gloats While Wall Street Journal Admits to Publishing CCP Propaganda,"The Wall Street Journal published Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda on Wednesday and there’s nobody happier than the CCP themselves. Moreover, the Journal appears to be fine with it, according to a new statement given to the National Pulse.“We have run numerous editorials and op-eds highly critical of China’s handling of the coronavirus, its deception, and manipulation of the World Health Organization,” said the paper’s editorial page editor Paul Gigot when asked for comment.“We’ve also recently criticized China’s military moves in the South China Sea, its crackdown in Hong Kong, and its theft of intellectual property, among other offenses against global norms.“I thought our readers, who are too busy to be able to read the Chinese media, deserved to hear unfiltered what the Chinese are saying. Our readers are smart enough to sort the truth from the propaganda.”That’s an overt admission by the Journal of publishing CCP propaganda, ostensibly as a means by which to “balance” their critiques. That’s not how this works.Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party is so excited about their disinformation victory that they’ve taken a victory lap via Chinese state media itself.The gloating in CGTN took the following form overnight:Xie criticized those even trying to make a fortune out of the pandemic, saying that they have demanded reparations from China, a chilling reminder of the Boxer Indemnity foreign powers coerced China into paying more than a century ago.Yes, that’s the Wall Street Journal laying up a slam dunk for China to attack those who believe China owes the world reparations for the COVID-19 virus.Congressmen, Senators, and even the President of the United States have suggested as much.You almost have to admire the savvy behind the CCP’s information tyranny.Hong Kong’s brutal oppressor—Xie Feng—writes an op-ed in one of the most well regarded newspaper’s in America, where he fabricates some nonsense about “everyone being in the fight together”. Then, because of Feng’s position, the CCP’s media apparatus treats the article as a news hook to pump the exact same message again.Discussing the original placement of the piece on the War Room: Pandemic podcast on Wednesday, co-host Raheem Kassam predicted the CCP would “be poppin’ bottles” i.e. celebrating over the matter.Articles in CGTN and Xinhua News prove his prediction correct.Yesterday on @WarRoomPandemic I warned the Chinese Communist Party would be taking a victory lap over placing an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.Today, they did.See my next tweet… pic.twitter.com/HlhX5g8yn4— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) May 14, 2020In running the op-ed at all, the Journal lent its 130-year-old gravitas to Feng’s words.If Feng published his bloviating nonsense in some media outlet that the CCP owns, it would’ve been dismissed, even unseen. It would’ve blunted the debilitating effects of the disinformation.Instead, China gets to pretend that the Wall Street Journal—a primarily American outlet—is functioning as some form of conduit for a joint international effort by China and America to fight the virus together.If China was going to join the fight with America, why would they use the World Health Organization as their patsy in convincing the entire globe that such a fight doesn’t exist?China will keep making stuff up, and American media institutions have a responsibility to reject it, debunk it, or caveat it. Something the Wall Street Journal incredibly failed to do.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/chinese-media-gloats-over-wsj-propaganda/
3,Politics,California Republican Wins in First Flip Since 1998… Democrats Should Be TERRIFIED,"FiveThirtyEight claimed ahead of the two special U.S. House elections on Tuesday night that the races “could hint at another blue wave in 2020” if Democrats were able to win in California and be competitive in Wisconsin.It didn’t go that way.In Wisconsin, Congressman Sean Duffy of the 7th District had resigned to attend to his family, as he and his wife are expecting a baby this fall who has been diagnosed with a heart defect.The outspoken pro-life and Catholic representative was popular in the largely rural district in northern Wisconsin, winning five terms handily, though Democrat U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin almost carried the district in 2018.The special election to succeed him featured Republican state Sen. Tom Tiffany and Democrat law professor Tricia Zunker. Democrats had hoped to at least give Tiffany a run for his money, but it was never really close: Tiffany won 57 percent – 43 percent on Tuesday night.The bigger story of the evening was California’s Los Angeles-area 25th District, where Democrat Katie Hill resigned after reports of sexual misconduct with a congressional staffer.Hill won the seat in 2018 in a 9-point victory, becoming the first Democrat to win the district since 1990.It seemed to be another death knell for Republicans in California, who have become an endangered species. California holds nonpartisan blanket primaries, where the top two finishers advance to the general election, regardless of party. Republican Mike Garcia, a Navy veteran, took the second spot, while Democrat Christy Smith, a state assemblywoman, took the first spot in the primary.Both sides spent heavily in the California race.Democrats sought to extend the exile of Republican members of Congress in suburban areas, while Republicans wanted to take the seat back in a district where Hillary Clinton won by 7 points in 2016.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and Democrat House Majority PAC spent a combined $2.2 million, while the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) and Republican Congressional Leadership fund nearly matched the Democrats with $2.1 million.Hill even emerged out of the shadows with a $200,000 TV ad campaign railing against President Trump urging voters to turn out, though she didn’t explicitly mention the candidates.Most interesting, however, was that the California election was conducted almost entirely by mail due to the coronavirus.Los Angeles County mailed all registered voters a ballot, regardless of whether they requested one.Conventional wisdom is that mail balloting hurts Republicans due to the increased risk of voter fraud, and the prospect that this November’s elections will see unprecedented levels of absentee voting due to the coronavirus is making Republicans around the country nervous.But it didn’t play out that way in California: Garcia walloped Smith 56 percent to 44 percent. It’s the first time any California Republican has flipped a Democrat-held seat from blue to red since 1998.Tuesday’s elections have given Democrats reason to worry.Garcia’s decisive victory in an almost all-mail election is a shot across the bow, President Trump’s popularity has risen during the pandemic, despite the media’s best efforts, and Joe Biden is an extraordinarily weak standard bearer for his party.The coronavirus is making one thing certain: no one knows how the next six months will play out.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/california-republican-wins-in-first-flip-since-1998/
4,Politics,"A ‘Recipe for Disaster’: Dem Governors Demanded COVID-19 Patients Were Returned to Nursing Homes, Contributing to Thousands of Deaths","Calls to protect the elderly went unheeded by Democratic Governors Cuomo, Whitmer, Wolf, and Newsom, according to bombshell reports scarcely discussed by broadcast media outlets.These Democratic Party governors not only failed to prioritize the safety of vulnerable people in their state nursing homes, they appear to have willfully endangered those most at risk by forcing nursing homes to admit coronavirus patients.Numerous local reports prove the theme across the Democrat-run states of New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and California.“Gov. Cuomo admits he was wrong to order nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients,” read the headline of the New York Post.Which raises the obvious question – why was Gov. Cuomo allowing sick patients into confined facilities all along?“That’s a good question, I don’t know,” the governor said when asked in mid-April.AARP warned New York weeks agoNursing Homes Balk at COVID Patient Transfers From Hospitalshttps://t.co/zRFOhvNCsi— Jack Posobiec (@JackPosobiec) May 11, 2020A few weeks later, New York’s policy was changed, but not before over 5,000 nursing home dwellers died on Cuomo’s watch. That’s a quarter of the state’s deaths.Nursing homes themselves were calling for more testing and personal protective equipment at the time, to protect themselves and patients.Mark Parkinson, President & CEO of the American Health Care Association (AHCA) and Dr. David Gifford, Chief Medical Officer for AHCA issued the following statement addressing state orders directing nursing homes to accept all hospital patients in late March:“Multiple states are considering adopting an order similar to what was issued in New York that requires every nursing home to admit hospital patients who have not been tested for COVID-19 and to admit patients who have tested positive. This approach will introduce the highly contagious virus into more nursing homes. There will be more hospitalizations for nursing home residents who need ventilator care and ultimately, a higher number of deaths. Issuing such an order is a mistake and there is a better solution.”The two went on to spell out their preferred plan: to establish segregated nursing homes for coronavirus patients. They called the Democratic governors’ plan a “recipe for disaster”.USA Today was one of the only major outlets that bothered to cover the matter in early May. Their headline on May 2nd read: “States ordered nursing homes to take COVID-19 residents. Thousands died.”The national outlet noted: “In Pennsylvania, about 65% of coronavirus deaths were nursing home residents, and New Jersey had 3,200 residents of long-term care homes die due to complications from the virus, about 40% of the statewide total”.“The whole thing has just been handled awfully… by everybody in regard to nursing homes,” said Kathleen Cole, whose 89-year-old mother Dolores McGoldrick died on April 17 after contracting the virus at Ferncliff Nursing Home in Rhinebeck, New York.“It’s like a slaughterhouse at these places,” she continued.In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolfe (D) approved nursing homes’ mandatory acceptance of previous virus patients from hospitals. In that state, the USA Today network reported: “about 65% of coronavirus deaths were nursing-home residents, and in counties in the hardest hit southeastern part of the state, long-term care residents account for as much as 80% of county deaths.” In New Jersey, “3,200 residents of long-term care homes die due to complications from the virus; about 40% of the statewide total.”And in Gavin Newsom’s California, the Los Angeles Times reported on April 1st that “California regulators have told skilled nursing facility operators that they must accept patients even if they have the disease.”Back then, Patricia McGinnis of the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform said: “Sacrificing the lives of beloved nursing home residents is beyond unconscionable.”“California’s directive is nothing less than a death sentence for countless residents. The state should instead look to alternative locations such as hotels and conference centers as much safer places to send COVID-19 patients for care,” McGinnis said.And on April 20th, Dr. Michael Wasserman of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine told NPR: “If you push folks out of the hospitals to make space and you push them into nursing homes a couple weeks later… for every one of those you send to the nursing home, you may get 20 back in the hospital.”Michigan’s Whitmer scarcely did better.“Continued hospitalization until residents’ test negative will overwhelm the healthcare system and should be avoided,” the Michigan documents stated. Which meant patients were sent back to nursing homes.But none of these Democratic governors have been quizzed on their behaviors and decisions which have directly and demonstrably led to unnecessary deaths.Instead, the broadcast media especially has focused on broad, national narratives, often pointing their fingers at President Trump while also bizarrely asserting that the President does not have jurisdiction over the states.Corby King and Vinnie Ungro contributed to this report.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/nursing-homes-covid-19-scandal/

6,Politics,EXCLUSIVE – Laura Loomer: Quit Your Big Tech Addiction Before It ‘Quits’ You.,"You’re a social media addict and so was I. Big Tech has us hooked in, and while some conservatives are willing to be vocal about it, very few are willing to change their behaviors. That’s addiction.There’s a great debate about this between Vox’s Ezra Klein and author Nir Eyal. Klein – in response to Eyal’s denial that people hooked on Big Tech can be classed as “addicts” – offers what I think is a killer blow: “I actually think that if we don’t talk about addiction, we are letting these companies off the hook. That’s what I think is dangerous.”Of course it’s dangerous. As Jon Schweppe writes in the New York Post:Big Tech companies hire psychologists and neurologists to develop addictive techniques that will keep users on the hamster wheel as long as possible. The longer users stay on their platforms, the more advertisements the firms can serve and the more money they can make. Advertisers are the consumer; users are merely the product.It’s why Sen. Josh Hawley introduced the SMART Act:To prohibit social media companies from using practices that exploit human psychology or brain physiology to substantially impede freedom of choice, to require social media companies to take measures to mitigate the risks of internet addiction and psychological exploitation, and for other purposes.And yet many are unwilling to wrest themselves from the psychological clutches of Big Tech. A Big Tech not just intent on siphoning every cent they can out of you, but also forcing political bias and an uninformed and often sophomoric “world philosophy” down our throats.In Silicon Valley the consensus prevails: globalism good, Orange Man bad.Apps like Parler or Gab – truly free speech platforms – are overlooked by those with established accounts because they really don’t think Big Tech will come for them. But they will, with increasing speed, especially on the run up to a presidential election.If people care about free speech (and I really mean care, not just about their own perceived right to tweet) and if they are tired of online censorship of conservative voices, now would be the time to practice what they preach.Sure, these alternative platforms are not quite the size of their Big Tech competitors. But that Mom & Pop store you like visiting also doesn’t necessarily have the same things the big box retailers do. But you still prefer it. Why? Because it’s real. And neither Mom nor Pop feel the need to proselytize at you politically, nor shape or monitor your behavior like Amazon, Target, or otherwise.In other words, there may be room in your life for both. And you may even end up spending less time overall concerning yourself with the digital world as a result.Think about it this way: right now people get stuck in a social media loop. You load up Instagram, then Facebook, then Twitter. Then repeat.Introduce a couple of other options in here and you’ll learn to disturb that “constant scroll/refresh” mentality.You’ll see stories you hadn’t seen before, because Twitter crushes things from outlets like Breitbart or the National Pulse. And you’ll be more likely to hit “SHARE” and send it in an email to someone. Loop broken.Right now Twitter and Facebook feed you things to keep you angry, fearful, and constantly refreshing. These other platforms don’t do that. In fact Parler specifically caters towards data security and doesn’t try to know everything about you. Big Tech’s 24/7 data rape mentality is just creepy.But we’ve invited these digital peeping Toms into our lives. They live in our phones.If you dare to go so far: hit delete altogether.When people complain about bans and ask to be put back online, the only people who benefit are Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg. Oh, and their foreign investors.Every time a popular conservative media influencer tweets or makes a post on Facebook that goes viral, Silicon Valley types get richer and more powerful. By accepting the monopoly, conservatives enable their oppressors.It is the very definition of an abusive relationship: conservatives are getting abused by Big Tech, and then beg their abusers to accept them once again. Then, when Big Tech allows the abusive relationship to continue with even more conditions, conservatives further silence themselves through self censorship so that big tech doesn’t slap them silly with yet another suspension or ban.This cycle continues until the victim breaks free, but often times, the situation turns lethal, and the abuser actually kills. Big tech wants to kill you off.It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but the longer you allow your addiction to keep you in your abusive relationship, the more you increase the odds of becoming another statistic of digital extermination, when you could easily break free and engage in a relationship with a platform that actually respects you.For two years I have listened to countless conservatives tell me they have sympathy for my situation – which you can read more about here – but the number of people this has happened to has only increased. We simply don’t have a handle on it. And we don’t have a handle on it because we aren’t willing to protest forcefully enough.With six months until the presidential election and with a pandemic with no end in site, there is no more time for half-hearted outrage, nor for virtue signaling on the matter. The time to act is now.The First Amendment is the foundational principle of our Constitutional Republic, and it is what separates us from the rest of the world.Tyranny, oppression, and authoritarian regimes silence political dissent and “wrong think” in order to control the masses. In many parts of the world like China, Iran, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia, people are literally jailed and killed for speaking up.Censorship is a matter of life or death. It is not a marketing tool, and “influencers” who use their social media “lockouts” and temporary bans as a way to simply generate press without taking action to move to sites that do not engage in censorship ought to be ashamed of themselves for their mind numbing hypocrisy.Whether you are a Democrat, a Republican, an independent, or not political at all, we should all be united in support of preserving and protecting this God given right.And remember this the next time you load up Twitter: Big Tech is not America First. There is nothing MAGA about Big Tech.As millions of Americans continue to file for unemployment and as small businesses shutter, Big Tech – which conducts the majority of their manufacturing in China – is only getting richer.This is why I decided to run for U.S. Congress, and this is why big tech tyranny and censorship is a cornerstone of my campaign.As a declared Congressional candidate in Florida’s 21st Congressional district, which is President and Mrs. Trump’s home residence and voting location, not only am I banned on all social media sites as an individual, but these same sites will not allow my campaign to have accounts.Despite being the most banned woman in the world, I have launched a very successful congressional campaign in which I am the frontrunner, and while only having access to Parler and Gab, I have out fundraised all of my opponents combined for three fundraising quarters in a row.This includes out fundraising Lois Frankel, my opponent, who is a four term obstructionist Democrat, and one of the first to call for President Trump’s impeachment.You can restore your following outside of Twitter and Facebook. There is life outside of Twitter and Facebook. It may seem scary at first, but it takes courage to take the first step in making a difference and creating long lasting change.As the saying goes, “actions speak louder than words”.Don’t let Big Tech kill you off. Don’t let Big Tech hand pick election winners.Join me on the other side where we can all be heard together.Find out more about my campaign for Congress, here. And if you want to see what a real free speech platform looks like, follow me on Parler, here.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/exclusive-loomer-quit-your-big-tech-addiction-before-it-quits-you/
7,Politics,She Who Shall Not Be Named: A Candidate for Political Office is Out-Raising All Her Opponents Despite A Big Tech Ban,"An “outsider” political candidate out-raising her opponents, at the cutting edge of campaigning, and refusing to kowtow to her party’s establishment. No, it’s not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but you’d be forgiven for not knowing this name.Why?Because Laura Loomer – running for United States Congress to represent Florida’s 21st congressional district – is perma-banned by almost all digital media platforms who are clearly utilizing Big Tech’s monopolies to suppress a political candidate.Florida’s 21st is a Democratic district in Palm Beach County Florida , and perhaps more interestingly, the registered voting home of U.S. President Donald J. Trump. Loomer, 26, has now out-raised the Democratic incumbent Rep. Lois Frankel for three consecutive quarters. But media both local and national seem disinterested in covering her race. Why? Because just like candidate Trump in 2016: talking about her success – even to deride her – might just help.Congressman ⁦@DrPaulGosar⁩ is correct here.  When a corporation like @twitter provides resources to Democrat but bans #LauraLoomer it is illegal corporate campaign contribution.  FEC can’t act so AG Barr and DOJ must! https://t.co/bMPZMhDsiS— Charlie Spies (@cspiesdc) May 9, 2020Loomer has been banned from almost every social media and tech platform. Ostensibly, we’re supposed to be terrified that this diminutive, Jewish Republican lady from Florida might cause some kinda of “far right” uprising in the United States.As a result, candidate Loomer is verboten.She is banned from all mainstream social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Yes, she has an eccentric (some would say authentic) personality, which bleeds into her citizen journalism. And yes, she’s a pretty outspoken critic of fundamentalist Islam.Many diminutive Jewish ladies – especially in Europe – are.But while the media will happily acknowledge the Jewish flight from Europe, they refuse to acknowledge a similar situation could occur in the United States. Despite their constant warnings that European-style ultra-nationalism, or fascism, have already landed on America’s shores.Loomer was banned from Twitter after calling Somali-American legislator Ilhan Omar anti-Jewish. Omar, quite evidently, has a track record of supporting wildly anti-Israel and arguably anti-Jewish positions. She’s even been lauded by notorious anti-Semite David Duke – something the media prosecuted President Trump for publicly in 2016, but for which they have scarcely quizzed Omar.Loomer was also banned from Facebook for supposedly violating its policies on “dangerous” individuals and organizations. She’s even been banned from Uber and Lyft: she literally can’t even get a ride. Despite it all, Loomer has never incited violence against anyone, yet has received countless death threats as a result of the media and Big Tech’s demonizations of her.With respect to being called “dangerous,” Loomer told The National Pulse: “The media has allowed Facebook to get away with designating me a dangerous individual with no due process. Even more alarming, the media hasn’t batted an eyelid after Facebook posted an update to its community standards saying it was fine to post death threats against me. All of this is thoroughly documented in my lawsuits, which the media has, of course, also ignored.”The Florida resident’s removal from social media culminated with a ban by Instagram in 2019. Soon after, Loomer decided to use her lack of platform to run for Congress: a move aimed at directly challenging tech censorship and what she regards as free speech suppression. So far, she has been a force to be reckoned with in her Congressional race.Despite being in a deep blue, Democrat stronghold with incumbent Rep Lois Frankel seeking a fifth term, Loomer has been able to out-raise everyone in the field – Frankel included.  She torched Frankel’s fundraising by 2.5 times in the first quarter of 2020. If any left-wing candidate had done this with no social media presence, CNN would be producing documentaries about the phenomenon. And imagine if Loomer had been able to tap into her once-large social media following, like her Twitter account with more than 260,000 at the time of her ban.The scenario has caused sitting Republican Congressmen to critique the digital media giants for putting their finger on the scales in an arguably nationally important election. Remember, the Congressman for FL-21 is the Congressman for the President of the United States.Rep. Gosar wrote in a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr this past week: “In the case of one person, Laura Loomer, all she has done is been an outspoken advocate for America First public policy, shared her concerns as a Jewish woman about threats from anti-Semites, and publicly supported President Trump.”Loomer said of her situation: “As the most banned woman in the world, I find it to be increasingly alarming how the media on both the Left and the Right have refused to highlight the terrifying violation of my civil rights that has been carried out by big tech. “As a declared congressional candidate in Florida’s 21st congressional district, my campaign has also been banned from having any social media, as well as being denied the ability to raise money on PayPal. Despite the bans, I have now out fundraised the Democrat incumbent Lois Frankel for three fundraising quarters in a row, and the President has retweeted in support of my candidacy twice.”Loomer’s success on the campaign trail would typically make her a formidable opponent and in turn a public figure deserving of a platform upon which to campaign. She hasn’t even been able to establish an official campaign account by which to communicate with the public.The case raises further questions.What does Big Tech do if Loomer wins her party’s primary and becomes the nominee? What if she wins the election proper and is selected by Floridians as their representative? Do they continue their ban? Do they back down? Loomer’s campaign raised $204,786 in the first quarter of 2020, while Democrat incumbent Lois Frankel came in second with just $82,876. She also out-raised all other Republican candidates combined. Donations to the Loomer campaign have come from over 10,000 individual donors with an average donation of $52.00. In contrast, a majority of money for Frankel’s re-election efforts have come from large political action committee (PAC) funding. The recent emergence of the coronavirus crushed in-person campaigning, and while Loomer was the first congressional candidate to take action. She suspended door knocking efforts as well as other public events, and decided to pay a filing fee rather than continue her attempts to get enough petitions signed in person. She also directed her campaign staff and volunteers to shift their efforts to making masks for first responders in need of protect equipment and coordinated a blood drive.Despite it all, she’s still refused the ability to reach the public. In other words, the tech giants are providing opportunities to her opponents but not to her. In other, other words: Big Tech is picking election winners and losers.Loomer told The National Pulse: “Tech censorship is not unique to me. Everyday, there are increasing reports of conservatives being silenced and banned on social media for expressing peaceful political speech. These same social media companies have gone as far as even censoring President Trump himself, deleting several of his tweets and even labeling some of his factual tweets about Joe Biden as misinformation. “Big tech is not only interfering in an election by denying my campaign access to social media, but they are proving to be one of the biggest threats to election integrity in all races  this election year. With the coronavirus pandemic, candidates have had to result to virtual campaigning. How is one supposed to virtual campaign while completely deplatformed? It’s time for big tech censorship to be taken seriously by our elected officials and the media. The results of all elections in 2020 depends on it.”Time will tell if Loomer can overcome Big Tech’s election meddling, censorship and the related media blackout in her efforts to flip Florida’s 21st congressional district red.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/she-who-shall-not-be-named-a-candidate-for-political-office/
8,Politics,EXCLUSIVE: Chinese Propaganda Attacking Steve Bannon Written by Fake ‘Security Analyst’ With Fraudulent Credentials,"CGTN.com, the official website for China’s Global Television Network, published a propaganda piece on Monday bashing former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.The article’s author appears to have faked the credentials of “Security Analyst” at the London School of Economics.Bannon has berated and exposed the Chinese Communist Party for their egregious human rights record, exploitative trade practices, and – most recently – their efforts to conceal the novel coronavirus from the world. “I think the world’s going to hold them in judgment, and that judgment is not going to be very pretty. They owe trillions, if not tens of trillions of dollars,” Bannon said on CNBC’s Squawk Box.In a piece for CGTN, Hannan Hussain – who claimed to be a security analyst at the London School of Economics’ South Asia Centre – wrote: “Contrary to Bannon’s claims, there are no trillions up for grabs, because Washington’s reckless handling of the pandemic – from suppression of information to a coordinated political campaign against China – has eclipsed the credibility of the serving administration.”The London School of Economics told The National Pulse in a statement post-publication of the original story:Mr Hussain is not a ‘Security Analyst’ with LSE South Asia Centre nor does he hold any other position at LSE. The position of ‘Security Analyst’ does not even exist at our Centre.Hussain’s propaganda piece for the Chinese Communist Party’s state-sanctioned news outlet predictably labels Steve Bannon a xenophobe, racist, etc. The piece also notes that some American academics, whom Hussain calls “lifelong threats to the likes of Bannon,” have disparaged Bannon’s reparations argument. As much as he hopes, Hussain is not unique. For decades, bureaucrats in Washington, Wall Street corporatists, and intellectual elites at institutional universities like Harvard have kowtowed to China’s brutal communist regime. Hussain appears to have published two blogs with the LSE in the past, but does not hold a position in the university.Even another of Hussain’s publishers – The Diplomat magazine – has listed China Central Television (CCTV) as “long standing weapon in Beijing’s arsenal of repression”.Do your editors @Diplomat_APAC know you're writing propaganda pieces for the ""long standing weapon in Beijing's arsenal of repression""? pic.twitter.com/GLwBW3l12j— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) May 4, 2020When asked to comment on his work for the Chinese Communist Party, Hussein blocked National Pulse editor Raheem Kassam.Preliminary US investigations indicate that, after learning of the possible pandemic, the Chinese government hid the information from the Chinese people for six days and allowed the city of Wuhan to host a mass banquet as millions began traveling for Lunar New Year celebrations. President Xi Jinping did not warn the Chinese people of the outbreak until the seventh day, January 20th. By this time, more than 3,000 people had already been infected.A leaked dossier from the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance – including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand – obtained exclusively by Australia’s Daily Telegraph newspaper finds that the Chinese Communist Party intentionally hid or destroyed evidence pertaining to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The report also highlights China’s suppression of evidence regarding the outbreak – including, but not limited to, bleaching wet market stalls, censoring evidence of asymptomatic carriers, and refusing to accommodate sample requests from other countries. Senior US intelligence officials told Fox News that the reports of the dossier are consistent with United States investigations into the origins of the outbreak. “I’ve been heartened to see Australia, other countries joining us, demanding an investigation, because while we know this started in Wuhan, China, we don’t yet know from where it started,” United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. “And in spite of our best efforts to get experts on the ground, they continue to try and hide and obfuscate.” Last Thursday, April 30th, President Trump also confirmed that he had personally seen intelligence linking the Wuhan Institute of Virology to the origin of the virus. When asked to elaborate, President Trump said: “I can’t tell you that, I’m not allowed to tell you that.” The Chinese Communist Party’s refusal to include outside actors in their investigations into the origins and spread of the novel coronavirus prove China-hawks like Steve Bannon are right to refer to the global pandemic as China’s “biological Chernobyl.”The 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster and USSR’s subsequent cover-up resulted in the endangerment of European populations and ultimately devastating loss of life. China’s botched response to the novel coronavirus pandemic seems to evidence Mark Twain’s famous maxim: “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Especially when it comes to communist regimes. This much we know: CCP running dogs like Hussain are on the wrong side of history. This article has been updated to reflect the statement by the London School of Economics asserting Mr Hussain holds no position there.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/chinas-global-television-network-steve-bannon-cant-be-trusted/
9,Politics,Wall Xi Journal: Murdoch Paper Publishes CCP’s Hong Kong Enforcer Who Claims ‘China Wants to Help the World’,"With such an overwhelming supply of domestically supplied fake news, it’s hard to imagine that America would need to outsource disinformation to China. The Wall Street Journal apparently disagrees, deciding to publish overt propaganda for the CCP in today’s paper.The writer behind the article is Xie Feng.Feng is the current commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Hong Kong. That’s a high ranking official for the People’s Republic of China who is tasked with brutally suppressing pro-democracy and rule of law protests in Hong Kong.A recent crackdown in the region saw leading anti-CCP activists like Jimmy Lai and Martin Lee arrested.The article in the Journal makes the absurd argument that China wants to help the world fight coronavirus. That’s a lot like saying the arsonist wants to join the firefighters in putting out the house fire across the street. But, propaganda isn’t supposed to make sense. It’s written with a more nefarious purpose.In this case, Xie Feng’s propaganda is designed to rewrite history. It’s created to erase the CCP’s complicity for the global coronavirus pandemic, and portray them as merely another victim of a horrible natural disaster.He writes almost a carbon copy of what Chinese propaganda outlets have promoted for months:China was the first to spot and report the outbreak, identify the pathogen, and share its genome sequence with the World Health Organization and the rest of the world. Yet China has been accused of coverups and delays and put in the dock. At the same time, those who failed to test, report and act in a timely fashion are passing judgment on others. Isn’t it a bit ironic?But we now know the CCP colluded with the World Health Organization to delay the declaration of the global pandemic while the CCP vacuumed up PPE supplies around the world.In fact, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made clear recently: “China didn’t share all the information it had. It covered up how dangerous the disease is. It didn’t report sustained human-to-human transmission for a month, until it was inside every province in China. It censored those who tried to warn the world… and it destroyed existing samples.”And Newsweek reported Tuesday:The CIA believes China tried to prevent the World Health Organization from sounding the alarm on the coronavirus outbreak in January—a time when Beijing was stockpiling medical supplies from around the world. A CIA report, the contents of which were confirmed to Newsweek by two U.S. intelligence officials, said China threatened the WHO that the country would stop cooperating with the agency’s coronavirus investigation if the organization declared a global health emergency.The Wall Street Journal, in a stunning turn of events, is offering China a helping hand in its propaganda efforts.Why?",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/wall-xi-journal-ccp-propaganda/

Matt Gaetz, a close ally of the President and ‘rising star of the Trumpian right’, launched his very own podcast, ‘Hot Takes with Matt Gaetz.’In the inaugural episode, Gaetz breaks down ‘Obamagate,’ criticizes China and the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s handling of the virus, and updates his listeners on “President Trump’s Congressional War Council.”“One of the reasons I think Obamagate is trending on Twitter and a big part of the national discussion now is that we’re starting to learn just how early the pollution of the political discussion occurred when it came to delegitimizing President Trump and the officials who may have been involved,” the Congressman explained.“With these latest disclosures and declassification of documents, it’s very clear that from the beginning, from back in 2017 there was always a plan to delegitimize the Trump presidency – both within our country and outside of it.”LAUNCHED TODAY: Tune in for the *FIRST* episode of my Podcast ""Hot Takes with Matt Gaetz.""In this episode: I hit back at @60Minutes' hit piece, take a deeper dive into #Obamagate, and divulge the latest on my White House meeting with @POTUS.LISTEN: https://t.co/nirBqHRiNe— Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) May 11, 2020“Did the GOP blow it when we had the majority?” Gaetz asked, detailing the inadequacy of Paul Ryan, Trey Gowdy, and Bob Goodlatte’s leadership on the issue.“The Republicans had the majority. We had the ability to run every lead to ground, to present the evidence before the American people, to make it impossible not to prosecute these criminals who are trying to steal the democracy away from the voters.”Gaetz contrasted the hundreds of subpoenas and the impeachment attempt by the Democrats with Republican inaction: “We did not send out one subpoena. We did not hold anyone in contempt. We did not use impeach power – and I’m not saying that necessarily we would’ve had to use the impeachment power, but there was not even a threat of that when we had control because we were just far too accepting of what these institutions were saying to us.”On Monday night, Gowdy appeared on “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” admitted his 2018 mistake of inaction under pressure from Carlson: “I made a lot of mistakes in life: relying on briefings and not insisting on the documents.”Just saw @TuckerCarlson press @TGowdySC on his defense of the FBI when we needed Gowdy on *our* side.

He confronts China, and I’m grateful that he does it,” Gaetz said. He continued: “One area that we need to confront China in the wake of the Wuhan virus is the area of medical diplomacy.”“I take some exception to the fact that the U.S. taxpayer is off providing even one dollar to research that’s going on in places where we can’t necessarily trust the governments to provide us accurate information,” Gaetz asserted, referencing a 3.7 million dollar grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Wuhan Institute of Virology is a subcontractor of the recipient of this grant, receiving approximately eight hundred thousand dollars.Republican leaders failed to act boldly when we had control.Then the voters gave power to the Democrats.And they corruptly impeached our President. https://t.co/JvwTv3mEI4— Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) May 9, 2020Gaetz discussed the issue on “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” explaining that the Wuhan Institute of Virology sequenced the virus and withheld the information for ten days.“I would expect if someone is in partnership with the U.S. government and the U.S. taxpayer that that means – at the least in the time of a pandemic, in the time of an outbreak – that we could count on them to be honest and to be truthful with us.

11,Politics,EXCLUSIVE – Laura Loomer: Quit Your Big Tech Addiction Before It ‘Quits’ You.,"You’re a social media addict and so was I. Big Tech has us hooked in, and while some conservatives are willing to be vocal about it, very few are willing to change their behaviors. That’s addiction.There’s a great debate about this between Vox’s Ezra Klein and author Nir Eyal. Klein – in response to Eyal’s denial that people hooked on Big Tech can be classed as “addicts” – offers what I think is a killer blow: “I actually think that if we don’t talk about addiction, we are letting these companies off the hook. That’s what I think is dangerous.”Of course it’s dangerous. As Jon Schweppe writes in the New York Post:Big Tech companies hire psychologists and neurologists to develop addictive techniques that will keep users on the hamster wheel as long as possible. The longer users stay on their platforms, the more advertisements the firms can serve and the more money they can make. Advertisers are the consumer; users are merely the product.It’s why Sen. Josh Hawley introduced the SMART Act:To prohibit social media companies from using practices that exploit human psychology or brain physiology to substantially impede freedom of choice, to require social media companies to take measures to mitigate the risks of internet addiction and psychological exploitation, and for other purposes.And yet many are unwilling to wrest themselves from the psychological clutches of Big Tech. A Big Tech not just intent on siphoning every cent they can out of you, but also forcing political bias and an uninformed and often sophomoric “world philosophy” down our throats.In Silicon Valley the consensus prevails: globalism good, Orange Man bad.Apps like Parler or Gab – truly free speech platforms – are overlooked by those with established accounts because they really don’t think Big Tech will come for them. But they will, with increasing speed, especially on the run up to a presidential election.If people care about free speech (and I really mean care, not just about their own perceived right to tweet) and if they are tired of online censorship of conservative voices, now would be the time to practice what they preach.Sure, these alternative platforms are not quite the size of their Big Tech competitors. But that Mom & Pop store you like visiting also doesn’t necessarily have the same things the big box retailers do. But you still prefer it. Why? Because it’s real. And neither Mom nor Pop feel the need to proselytize at you politically, nor shape or monitor your behavior like Amazon, Target, or otherwise.In other words, there may be room in your life for both. And you may even end up spending less time overall concerning yourself with the digital world as a result.Think about it this way: right now people get stuck in a social media loop. You load up Instagram, then Facebook, then Twitter. Then repeat.Introduce a couple of other options in here and you’ll learn to disturb that “constant scroll/refresh” mentality.You’ll see stories you hadn’t seen before, because Twitter crushes things from outlets like Breitbart or the National Pulse. And you’ll be more likely to hit “SHARE” and send it in an email to someone. Loop broken.Right now Twitter and Facebook feed you things to keep you angry, fearful, and constantly refreshing. These other platforms don’t do that. In fact Parler specifically caters towards data security and doesn’t try to know everything about you. Big Tech’s 24/7 data rape mentality is just creepy.But we’ve invited these digital peeping Toms into our lives. They live in our phones.If you dare to go so far: hit delete altogether.When people complain about bans and ask to be put back online, the only people who benefit are Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg. Oh, and their foreign investors.Every time a popular conservative media influencer tweets or makes a post on Facebook that goes viral, Silicon Valley types get richer and more powerful. By accepting the monopoly, conservatives enable their oppressors.It is the very definition of an abusive relationship: conservatives are getting abused by Big Tech, and then beg their abusers to accept them once again. Then, when Big Tech allows the abusive relationship to continue with even more conditions, conservatives further silence themselves through self censorship so that big tech doesn’t slap them silly with yet another suspension or ban.This cycle continues until the victim breaks free, but often times, the situation turns lethal, and the abuser actually kills. Big tech wants to kill you off.It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but the longer you allow your addiction to keep you in your abusive relationship, the more you increase the odds of becoming another statistic of digital extermination, when you could easily break free and engage in a relationship with a platform that actually respects you.For two years I have listened to countless conservatives tell me they have sympathy for my situation – which you can read more about here – but the number of people this has happened to has only increased. We simply don’t have a handle on it. And we don’t have a handle on it because we aren’t willing to protest forcefully enough.With six months until the presidential election and with a pandemic with no end in site, there is no more time for half-hearted outrage, nor for virtue signaling on the matter. The time to act is now.The First Amendment is the foundational principle of our Constitutional Republic, and it is what separates us from the rest of the world.Tyranny, oppression, and authoritarian regimes silence political dissent and “wrong think” in order to control the masses. In many parts of the world like China, Iran, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia, people are literally jailed and killed for speaking up.Censorship is a matter of life or death. It is not a marketing tool, and “influencers” who use their social media “lockouts” and temporary bans as a way to simply generate press without taking action to move to sites that do not engage in censorship ought to be ashamed of themselves for their mind numbing hypocrisy.Whether you are a Democrat, a Republican, an independent, or not political at all, we should all be united in support of preserving and protecting this God given right.And remember this the next time you load up Twitter: Big Tech is not America First. There is nothing MAGA about Big Tech.As millions of Americans continue to file for unemployment and as small businesses shutter, Big Tech – which conducts the majority of their manufacturing in China – is only getting richer.This is why I decided to run for U.S. Congress, and this is why big tech tyranny and censorship is a cornerstone of my campaign.As a declared Congressional candidate in Florida’s 21st Congressional district, which is President and Mrs. Trump’s home residence and voting location, not only am I banned on all social media sites as an individual, but these same sites will not allow my campaign to have accounts.Despite being the most banned woman in the world, I have launched a very successful congressional campaign in which I am the frontrunner, and while only having access to Parler and Gab, I have out fundraised all of my opponents combined for three fundraising quarters in a row.This includes out fundraising Lois Frankel, my opponent, who is a four term obstructionist Democrat, and one of the first to call for President Trump’s impeachment.You can restore your following outside of Twitter and Facebook. There is life outside of Twitter and Facebook. It may seem scary at first, but it takes courage to take the first step in making a difference and creating long lasting change.As the saying goes, “actions speak louder than words”.Don’t let Big Tech kill you off. Don’t let Big Tech hand pick election winners.Join me on the other side where we can all be heard together.Find out more about my campaign for Congress, here. And if you want to see what a real free speech platform looks like, follow me on Parler, here.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/exclusive-loomer-quit-your-big-tech-addiction-before-it-quits-you/

Jiang, however, chose to deflect from China and instead have a meltdown on the White House lawn.“Why are you saying that to me, specifically?” she cried, to which the President responded: “I’m saying it to anybody who would ask a nasty question like that.”At that moment the President tries to move on, only to be told by CNN’s Kaitlin Collins that she too was waiting for Trump to answer to Jiang’s outburst.At this point Jiang dangerously dropped her face mask and began shouting across the lawn in the President’s direction.It was at this point the presser was brought to a close.Thanks victim-wannabe Jiang, and of course a special mention for CCPNN.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/asian-american-cbs-reporter-mask-trump/
14,Politics,WATCH – NY Gov. Cuomo Bizarrely Calls COVID-19 a ‘European Virus’,"New York’s increasingly overexposed Governor Andrew Cuomo today confused and angered China-hawks by referring to COVID-19 as a “European virus”.Speaking at his daily press conference, Gov. Cuomo bizarrely declared: “Yes we have more cases than anyone else. Yes we had this European virus attack us and nobody expected it. But we’re not only going to change our trajectory, we’re going to change the trajectory more dramatically than any place else in the nation.”Gov Cuomo – in the surest sign he’s on the take from the CCP – has now resorted to calling it the “European virus”pic.twitter.com/7ahICKLwja— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) May 11, 2020It’s true. Cuomo did help to change the trajectory of the virus more dramatically than anywhere else in the United States: upward.Cuomo’s work in forcing nursing homes to take in coronavirus patients no doubt led to needless deaths.Regardless, his stance in calling it the “European virus” will confound even the most neutral of observers.The coronavirus – otherwise known as the ‘China virus’, or ‘CCP virus’ – emerged from Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China.It did not emerge in Europe.Despite these clear facts, it’s hard to see a situation where journalists would demand Cuomo stop using such evidently fake claims, as they did when President Trump made the correct claim that the virus came from China and should therefore be called the Chinese virus.Responding on Twitter, Republican National Convention spokeswomen Elizabeth Harrington declared of Cuomo’s misnomer: “And this victory lap Democrat Gov. Cuomo is doing is odd given the reporting last week that 65% of the outbreaks across the country came from New York And after he waited months to stop sending Covid patients into nursing homes.”""European virus""?And this victory lap Democrat Gov.

15,Politics,EXCLUSIVE: How A Pakistani Think Tank Launders CCP Propaganda For Western Audiences,"The credentials advertised to English-speaking audience by these state outlets are sometimes totally fake.A recent National Pulse exposé into “security analyst” Hannan Hussain exposed the China Global Television Network (CGTN) contributor’s fraudulent credentials from the London School of Economics South Asia Centre.After the revelation, CGTN – a registered foreign agent in the United States – edited Hussain’s bio on their website. It now reads: “Hannan Hussain is an Assistant Researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, and an author. He is also an international affairs commentator for The Diplomat, a leading foreign policy magazine based in Washington.”Hussain’s corrected byline exposed the Pakistani think-tank affiliation. In other words, commentators attempting – at an industrial scale – to influence U.S. foreign policy.A fellow CGTN contributor – Hamzah Hussain – is also employed by the think tank as an assistant researcher, publishing CCP puff pieces including “the irony of Trump’s campaign promise” and “why Washington cautioning the Gulf lacks merit or credibility.”IPRI lists “affiliation” with seven, mostly-CCP controlled, China-based entities on its website, regularly publishing articles advocating the entrenchment of China into all sectors of Pakistan’s economy and schools.The think tank’s leadership board, composed of current and former Pakistani government officials, also routinely endorses China’s gradual but persistent attempts to shepherd the country’s livelihood – not viewing Pakistan as a partner but instead as a colonial vassal.IPRI board member Ambassador Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry says: “The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is for the good and welfare of the people of Pakistan, the people of western China and, in fact, the people of the whole region. Many countries, including those in Central Asia, as well as those in our neighborhood, will benefit from this.Striking a similar tone, Ambassador Fauzia Nasreen Head – also on IPRI’s board – believes “China is Pakistan’s strategic and “all weather” friend and partner.”After receiving personal protective equipment donations from China, IPRI board member Senator Anwar ul Haq Kakar lauded China and Pakistan’s “friendship”. The PPE donation assisted Beijing’s broader “mask diplomacy” efforts where the country demanded public displays of praise and gratitude.This sycophancy predates coronavirus.IPRI frequently publishes reports highlighting the two countries’ “shared destiny,” depicting America as a “challenge to China’s peaceful rise,” and encourages a decoupling from the US: “Pakistan must rethink about its partnership with US. […] Fortunately, China is our immediate neighbor and long lasting friend and by improving our strategic partnership with China we can achieve better national, regional and global interests as compared to US.”The China Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) – a subsidiary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China – is one such Islamabad Policy Research Institute partner.The Islamabad Policy Research Institute similarly associates with China Arms Control and Disarmament Association (CACDA) — founded by CCP Standing Committee member, Li Daoyu —  and with China’s ‘Belt and Road Research Institute for International Cooperation and Development’ (BRRIICD).Announced in 2013 by President Xi Jinping, Beijing’s trillion-dollar ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ seeks to assert Chinese dominance through state-sponsored infrastructure development, a China-centered trade network, and international investments in nearly 70 countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe.Anxious to secure reliable oil access to meet their growing industrial demands, many of these foreign investment ventures target politically turbulent countries in the Middle East like Pakistan.In 2016, China committed $60 billion to build the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. China’s investment operation in Pakistan includes “a network of roads, pipelines, power plants, industrial parks, and a port along the Arabian Sea.”Promoting the agreement, Yao Jing, the Chinese ambassador to Pakistan, said: “Let us work together to push our all-weather friendship to new heights toward the realization of building the community of China-Pakistan shared future at an early date.”Despite warnings, Pakistani government officials like Khan Hasham Bin Saddique — the Pakistani Ambassador to Saudi Arabia — work closely with Chinese nationals to promote this regional occupation.In 2018, Saddique participated in an International Energy Forum seminar to discuss the Belt and Road Initiative as well as China’s oil and gas access in Riyadah.It was a pleasure to participate in International Energy Forum seminar on Belt and Road initiative and China's oil and gas held in Riyadh. pic.twitter.com/gTMQ88kLm0— Khan Hasham Bin Saddique (@hashambinsaddiq) May 8, 2018Saddique also heads the Islamabad Policy Research Institute where Hannan Hussain works as an assistant researcher.Touting “Pak China” collaboration on his social media, Saddique’s Islamabad Policy Research Institute routinely posts propaganda pieces from Chinese state-affiliated news organizations like CGTN.Laden with dept-trap diplomacy and ‘trojan horse’ investments, CPEC and the Chinese Communist Party’s greater global development strategy is a nightmare dressed like a daydream.Nonetheless, IPRI media puppets like Hannan Hussain and Hamzah R Hussain encourage regional powers like the UAE and Saudi Arabia to join Pakistan’s lead and consolidate their ties with China.One thing’s certain: the novel coronavirus pandemic represents the delegitimization of the Chinese Communist Party as a global player, and – by cementing alliances with anti-US foreign nations like Pakistan – it’s clear China is gearing up for a global supply chain showdown.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/ipri-ccp-ties/
16,Politics,EXCLUSIVE: 60 Minutes’ Trump Critic Doctor Donated to Hillary Clinton 13 Times in TWO MONTHS,"Dr. Peter Daszak, the researcher who appeared on 60 Minutes to criticize the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw millions of taxpayer dollars funding his joint research with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, donated to the Hillary Clinton campaign 13 times in 2016.While the segment hammers the Trump administration for letting “pandemic politics” influence its coronavirus response, 60 Minutes is guilty of its own charge: citing political affiliation only when it bolsters their anti-Trump smear campaign but ignoring it if it would force viewers to think twice about Dr. Daszak’s underlying motives.The infectious disease researcher and president of EcoHealth Alliance – the organization that received the $3.7 million grant in question – directed numerous donations towards the Hillary For America PAC, Clinton’s official campaign political action committee (PAC), totaling over $850.And of course, this narrative-crashing background information appeared nowhere in 60 Minutes’ spectacle.Yet they were sure to tee up Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz – the alleged peddler of misinformation that got the grant rescinded – as a bona fide Trump ally: “Gaetz is a vigorous defender of the president. He’s been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegedly threatening a witness against Mr. Trump, and he led a protest to delay impeachment testimony.”The show likened the administration’s decision to cut the grant to a “political disinformation campaign targeting China’s Wuhan Institute,” a probable origin of the virus.Critics including President Trump, however, have equated the segment to a cover up of the CCP’s botched virus response, silencing doctors who alerted co-workers about the growing pandemic and purposely withholding information from authorities and the world about its extent and transmission pathways..@CBS and their show, @60Minutes, are doing everything within their power, which is far less today than it was in the past, to defend China and the horrible Virus pandemic that was inflicted on the USA and the rest of the World. I guess they want to do business in China!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2020And this criticism is warranted: 60 Minutes, airing on the mainstream media outlet CBS, is a fount for left-wing talking points. They’ve cast Nancy Pelosi as a ‘Giant Slayer’ and ‘Patron Saint of Shade,’ fretted over Justice Kavanaugh’s “temperament” questioning if he “belonged on the Supreme Court,” and asked hardened President Trump disparager John McCain if he “worried that [President Trump] is not fit for the office?”And this is just their latest politically-motivated hit piece, letting China off the hook for spawning and spreading the virus while bolstering the CCP’s narrative that the US is impairing the world’s response.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/60-minutes-hillary-donor/
17,Politics,She Who Shall Not Be Named: A Candidate for Political Office is Out-Raising All Her Opponents Despite A Big Tech Ban,"An “outsider” political candidate out-raising her opponents, at the cutting edge of campaigning, and refusing to kowtow to her party’s establishment. No, it’s not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but you’d be forgiven for not knowing this name.Why?Because Laura Loomer – running for United States Congress to represent Florida’s 21st congressional district – is perma-banned by almost all digital media platforms who are clearly utilizing Big Tech’s monopolies to suppress a political candidate.Florida’s 21st is a Democratic district in Palm Beach County Florida , and perhaps more interestingly, the registered voting home of U.S. President Donald J. Trump. Loomer, 26, has now out-raised the Democratic incumbent Rep. Lois Frankel for three consecutive quarters. But media both local and national seem disinterested in covering her race. Why? Because just like candidate Trump in 2016: talking about her success – even to deride her – might just help.Congressman ⁦@DrPaulGosar⁩ is correct here.  When a corporation like @twitter provides resources to Democrat but bans #LauraLoomer it is illegal corporate campaign contribution.  FEC can’t act so AG Barr and DOJ must! https://t.co/bMPZMhDsiS— Charlie Spies (@cspiesdc) May 9, 2020Loomer has been banned from almost every social media and tech platform. Ostensibly, we’re supposed to be terrified that this diminutive, Jewish Republican lady from Florida might cause some kinda of “far right” uprising in the United States.As a result, candidate Loomer is verboten.She is banned from all mainstream social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Yes, she has an eccentric (some would say authentic) personality, which bleeds into her citizen journalism. And yes, she’s a pretty outspoken critic of fundamentalist Islam.Many diminutive Jewish ladies – especially in Europe – are.But while the media will happily acknowledge the Jewish flight from Europe, they refuse to acknowledge a similar situation could occur in the United States. Despite their constant warnings that European-style ultra-nationalism, or fascism, have already landed on America’s shores.Loomer was banned from Twitter after calling Somali-American legislator Ilhan Omar anti-Jewish. Omar, quite evidently, has a track record of supporting wildly anti-Israel and arguably anti-Jewish positions. She’s even been lauded by notorious anti-Semite David Duke – something the media prosecuted President Trump for publicly in 2016, but for which they have scarcely quizzed Omar.Loomer was also banned from Facebook for supposedly violating its policies on “dangerous” individuals and organizations. She’s even been banned from Uber and Lyft: she literally can’t even get a ride. Despite it all, Loomer has never incited violence against anyone, yet has received countless death threats as a result of the media and Big Tech’s demonizations of her.With respect to being called “dangerous,” Loomer told The National Pulse: “The media has allowed Facebook to get away with designating me a dangerous individual with no due process. Even more alarming, the media hasn’t batted an eyelid after Facebook posted an update to its community standards saying it was fine to post death threats against me. All of this is thoroughly documented in my lawsuits, which the media has, of course, also ignored.”The Florida resident’s removal from social media culminated with a ban by Instagram in 2019. Soon after, Loomer decided to use her lack of platform to run for Congress: a move aimed at directly challenging tech censorship and what she regards as free speech suppression. So far, she has been a force to be reckoned with in her Congressional race.Despite being in a deep blue, Democrat stronghold with incumbent Rep Lois Frankel seeking a fifth term, Loomer has been able to out-raise everyone in the field – Frankel included.  She torched Frankel’s fundraising by 2.5 times in the first quarter of 2020. If any left-wing candidate had done this with no social media presence, CNN would be producing documentaries about the phenomenon. And imagine if Loomer had been able to tap into her once-large social media following, like her Twitter account with more than 260,000 at the time of her ban.The scenario has caused sitting Republican Congressmen to critique the digital media giants for putting their finger on the scales in an arguably nationally important election. Remember, the Congressman for FL-21 is the Congressman for the President of the United States.Rep. Gosar wrote in a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr this past week: “In the case of one person, Laura Loomer, all she has done is been an outspoken advocate for America First public policy, shared her concerns as a Jewish woman about threats from anti-Semites, and publicly supported President Trump.”Loomer said of her situation: “As the most banned woman in the world, I find it to be increasingly alarming how the media on both the Left and the Right have refused to highlight the terrifying violation of my civil rights that has been carried out by big tech. “As a declared congressional candidate in Florida’s 21st congressional district, my campaign has also been banned from having any social media, as well as being denied the ability to raise money on PayPal. Despite the bans, I have now out fundraised the Democrat incumbent Lois Frankel for three fundraising quarters in a row, and the President has retweeted in support of my candidacy twice.”Loomer’s success on the campaign trail would typically make her a formidable opponent and in turn a public figure deserving of a platform upon which to campaign. She hasn’t even been able to establish an official campaign account by which to communicate with the public.The case raises further questions.What does Big Tech do if Loomer wins her party’s primary and becomes the nominee? What if she wins the election proper and is selected by Floridians as their representative? Do they continue their ban? Do they back down? Loomer’s campaign raised $204,786 in the first quarter of 2020, while Democrat incumbent Lois Frankel came in second with just $82,876. She also out-raised all other Republican candidates combined. Donations to the Loomer campaign have come from over 10,000 individual donors with an average donation of $52.00. In contrast, a majority of money for Frankel’s re-election efforts have come from large political action committee (PAC) funding. The recent emergence of the coronavirus crushed in-person campaigning, and while Loomer was the first congressional candidate to take action. She suspended door knocking efforts as well as other public events, and decided to pay a filing fee rather than continue her attempts to get enough petitions signed in person. She also directed her campaign staff and volunteers to shift their efforts to making masks for first responders in need of protect equipment and coordinated a blood drive.Despite it all, she’s still refused the ability to reach the public. In other words, the tech giants are providing opportunities to her opponents but not to her. In other, other words: Big Tech is picking election winners and losers.Loomer told The National Pulse: “Tech censorship is not unique to me. Everyday, there are increasing reports of conservatives being silenced and banned on social media for expressing peaceful political speech. These same social media companies have gone as far as even censoring President Trump himself, deleting several of his tweets and even labeling some of his factual tweets about Joe Biden as misinformation. “Big tech is not only interfering in an election by denying my campaign access to social media, but they are proving to be one of the biggest threats to election integrity in all races  this election year. With the coronavirus pandemic, candidates have had to result to virtual campaigning. How is one supposed to virtual campaign while completely deplatformed? It’s time for big tech censorship to be taken seriously by our elected officials and the media. The results of all elections in 2020 depends on it.”Time will tell if Loomer can overcome Big Tech’s election meddling, censorship and the related media blackout in her efforts to flip Florida’s 21st congressional district red.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/she-who-shall-not-be-named-a-candidate-for-political-office/
18,Politics,German Intel: China Told WHO to Hide Human-to-Human Coronavirus Transmission in Jan,"The Chinese Communist Party forced the World Health Organization (WHO) to refrain from notifying the world about human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus, causing a “four to six-week delay in fighting” the virus, according to Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service.The recently-released report corroborates the Trump administration’s narrative that China purposely withheld this critical information, delaying the world’s ability to respond: “According to the BND, China has urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to delay a global warning after the outbreak of the virus at the highest level. On January 21, China’s leader Xi Jinping asked WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to hold back information about a human-to-human transmission and to delay a pandemic warning.”This follows the Department of Homeland Security alleging the CCP’s intentional delay in notifying authorities of the outbreak was to stockpile medical supplies now in a global shortage.It’s also the latest proof of WHO’s subservience to the CCP, sacrificing global health by acquiescing to Beijing’s demands.Roughly one week after WHO assisted in the CCP-led cover up, they praised China’s “transparency” in a now-debunked statement from the body’s director, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “We appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak, especially the commitment from top leadership, and the transparency they have demonstrated, including sharing data and genetic sequence of the virus. WHO is working closely with the government on measures to understand the virus and limit transmission. WHO will keep working side-by-side with China and all other countries to protect health and keep people safe.”And Dr. Tedros is a repeat offender when it comes to covering up infectious disease outbreaks.Even The New York Times wrote in 2017 that he helped with “covering up three cholera epidemics in his home country, Ethiopia, when he was health minister — a charge that could seriously undermine his campaign to run the agency.”His actions were straight from Beijing’s playbook: “China denied for months in 2003 that it had a serious outbreak of lethal respiratory disease in its southern cities. That outbreak ultimately became known as SARS, for severe acute respiratory syndrome, and spread to several other countries, including Canada,” the article also noted.While establishment media outlets have covered Germany’s findings, they’ve willfully ignored this incriminating discovery. Unsurprisingly, they’ve amplified the only portion of the report that conflicts with the US intelligence, the theory that coronavirus originated in a Wuhan laboratory.Not only did the CCP botch its own coronavirus response, silencing doctors who alerted co-workers about the virus, but its calculated cover up impaired the ability of other governments to respond accurately, costing thousands of lives and taking an immeasurable economic toll.It proves that holding the CCP accountable for coronavirus is not merely a talking point; it’s a justified response to the virus it spawned, spread, and lied about.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/who-hid-transmission/
19,Politics,"EXC. Rep. Gaetz: End Reliance on China, Repatriate Production, And Restock Obama’s Depleted PPE Supplies","Not since World War II have American companies and citizens banded together so quickly to produce essential equipment to combat the coronavirus. It is this, the great American spirit of innovation, that will propel our Nation to new heights. by Congressman Matt Gaetz (FL-1)The vast coronavirus stimulus packages authorized by Congress surpass both the 2008 recession package and Roosevelt’s “New Deal.” A vast problem justifies a vast response, and coronavirus has been vast indeed: more Americans have died from COVID-19 than either the Vietnam or Korean wars. This is a pivotal moment in American history. Our response will shape our political landscape for decades to come.We can only bounce back if we analyze the critical issues COVID-19 has revealed, including America’s dependency on China, China’s misguided priorities, and the bureaucratic lenses through which we have for too long viewed health policy.Our dependence on China goes beyond what Americans find in their closets.Chinese firms supply more than 90 percent of U.S. antibiotics and nearly 80 percent of all basic ingredients in U.S. drugs. It is not only absurd but dangerous that we rely so heavily on the Communist Chinese regime for our fundamental health needs. Would we have relied on the Soviet Union like this, before, during, or after the Cold War? No.We must repatriate our supply chains, rein in foreign agents operating domestically, and focus with renewed vigor on enhancing America’s domestic production. The pandemic has shown the fragility of supply chains, and the dangers of depending too heavily on any one nation. Particularly China.International politics should stay out of hospitals. The world health community embraced this principle when battling AIDS, SARS, H1N1, and Ebola. But something changed with the CCP virus. The Chinese Communist Party’s outsized influence on World Health Organization’s (WHO) decision-making, coupled with China’s deliberate and dangerous lack of transparency, helped turn “impartial” organizations like the WHO into petri dishes of misinformation and inaction. With the number of worldwide cases just shy of four million, such an unwelcome transformation has cost the world dearly.While I applaud President Trump’s efforts to redirect WHO funds to our domestic efforts to fight the virus, we can do more.Health policy is an issue of national security. But due to increased global travel, urbanization, agricultural intensification, and greater exploitation of the environment, viral threats will continue to appear. A new strategy for fighting disease outbreaks is crucial.Fighting invisible enemies demands a new battle plan. Our soldiers in this fight are our healthcare workers and disease specialists; our frontlines are our hospitals and labs. Most importantly, our states — each one, a laboratory of democracy — will be able to approach public health differently, based on their unique geographic and demographic needs. Consider Florida. Our expeditious response to COVID-19, under the bold leadership of Governor Ron DeSantis, was able to identify vulnerable populations quickly, taking proactive steps to ensure the health and safety of these communities was prioritized. We knew, from analyzing transportation data, which areas were most likely to develop into the next “hot spots,” and took dramatic action to lessen our state’s risk factors. Limiting travel from high-risk areas like New York helped keep Florida safe — and lessened the risk for airline employees, TSA agents, hospital workers, and travelers alike. Florida’s response was successful because it was specific to Florida. No amount of “central planning” from Washington would have been anywhere near as effective. This is not to say there is no need for federal level planning. There is.The mobilization of industry and the passing of relief legislation are two very legitimate uses of federal authority. So too is re-stocking our national strategic stockpile, cruelly depleted under President Obama, and never replenished. Unlike Obama, whose “not my presidency, not my problem” approach left us desperately short on much-needed personal protective equipment (PPE), the Trump administration will leave America better-equipped to handle future health scares.One of the most consequential effects of any crisis is that, if unchecked, the government is afforded expansive new emergency powers. After 9/11, Congress voted the Patriot Act into law, an unprecedented expansion of the government’s ability to conduct warrantless searches, wiretaps, and other means of spying. Nineteen years later, the world is more connected than ever. As several countries have embraced draconian policies in the name of “public health,” we must remain vigilant not to let our fear of the virus be used as an excuse to curtail our liberties. The better we prepare for future crises, the more we will be able to respond to them without trampling on American citizens’ rights, lives, and livelihoods.As we mourn our losses and begin to rebuild, we have to strategize for the next viral threat. I have no doubt that America will make it through this era of uncertainty, and will prevail. If we can re-domesticate our supply chains, de-politicize global health, and listen to the wisdom of our states, America’s next Golden Age will soon be upon us.

20,Politics,Only in New York: Now Gov. Cuomo Wants Samaritan’s Purse Coronavirus Helpers to Pay NY Tax,"They say no good deed goes unpunished. In New York it seems you can be punished twice.Samaritan’s Purse, who went to NYC to help with the overflow of COVID patients, were protested and slandered by Councilman Corey Johnson and activists from the LGBTQ community forcing Mt Sinai to ask them to leave.It was bad enough healthcare workers were disrespect by the same city they were trying to help, but to add insult to injury, they’re being handed a bill on the way out.Governor Cuomo announced yesterday the organization along with other volunteer groups will be subjected to New York State taxes for the time that they were there.“We’re not in a position to provide any subsidies right now because we have a $13 billion deficit,” Cuomo said.Apparently any organization that comes to NY is obligated to pay state taxes after being there for 14 days or longer.Lawrence Spielman, a partner at the accounting firm Spielman, Koenigsberg and Parker explained that “these other states will have to register in New York, and do withholding here.”This came as quite a surprise for the folks at Samaritan’s Purse who had no idea that they could be taxed for volunteering to help in a time of need.NY sure has a funny way of saying thank you.“Our financial comptroller called me,” according to Ken Isaacs, a vice president of the organization, “and he said, ‘Do you know that all of you are going to be liable for New York state income tax?’“I didn’t know that,” Isaacs told PIX11 News.Before the coronavirus, New York state was already facing a six billion dollar deficit from years of mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility.Still, to penalize an organization in the form of a tax  for your own incompetence is a new low, even for Cuomo.More concerned with banning plastic bags, bail reform and failed alternative energy policies along with providing free health care, college tuition and drivers licenses to illegal aliens in his sanctuary city. It’s no surprise that NY has such a deficit.While the Governor is seeking a bailout from the federal government, it seems that he might have his hands full trying to receive it.The President said that he’s not too keen on the idea of taxpayers having to foot the bill for another State that mismanaged funds, especially ones that have sanctuary cities.“We’re not looking to recover 25 years of bad management and give them the money that they lost. That’s unfair to other states,” Trump said.He added: “If we’re going to do something for the states, I think we probably want something having to do with sanctuary cities.”After Hurricane Sandy the Governor waived the state tax on emergency workers for 90 days, something that Samaritan’s Purse hoped he would consider this time around.“If we can find a way for the governor’s office to look at this tax issue the way they did during Hurricane Sandy,” Isaacs said, “that would be an enormous benefit.”One thing is for certain, if the Governor insists on payment of taxes from Samaritan’s Purse and other relief organizations who so selflessly came to help when NY needed them most. They might just not get the help they need for future disasters.In other words, stop biting the hand that feeds you or eventually they’ll stop offering.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/cuomo-wants-samaritans-purse-to-pay-tax/
21,Politics,EXCLUSIVE – Parscale and Pence: Campaigning in the Age of Coronavirus & The New Trump Team App,"The United States is fighting an invisible enemy––and we all must continue to do our part to defeat this virus. Together, America will prevail.As our Nation bands together to overcome this unique challenge, we know that another important challenge nears. It’s the race for The White House on November 3, 2020. And the Trump Campaign is preparing like never before.We have to, because we’re facing a situation that no presidential campaign has ever confronted. Campaigning traditionally involves a great deal of in-person interaction, and that’s no longer possible for the time being. Fortunately, Team Trump has been breaking new ground in the realm of digital campaigning for years, so we were ready to ramp up those efforts when the pandemic struck.Continuing its dominance in the digital space, the Trump Campaign has launched a free Trump 2020 Campaign app to engage, identify, and gamify our entire campaign operations across America.The new Trump Campaign app is destined to be a game-changer in American politics.The brand-new Trump app is an incredible way to engage with new supporters and target voters online. The app also ensures that our campaign can be less reliant on platforms like Facebook and Twitter in order to convey our message.While our campaign continues to ensure the highest degree of safety during the coronavirus outbreak, the Trump app is ready to be utilized right now.Here’s how:Sign-up for Virtual EventsThe Trump Campaign went 100% digital in less than 24 hours following the coronavirus pandemic. On the Trump app, every single virtual event––for new volunteers, current field organizers, and coalitions––is listed on the app and available for registration.The app provides exclusive updates and news directly from the Campaign—allowing supporters to hear our message without the mainstream media spin. When virtual events go live on our multiple social networks, supporters will be the first to know through our app.Engage with Fully-Integrated Campaign OperationThe new Trump app includes interactive ‘how to’ videos to inform supporters on how they can help re-elect President Trump.Whether you become a Trump Neighbor Team Leader, enroll in our volunteer Trump Victory Leadership Initiative, or become a Bundler, this app masterfully integrates all of Campaign operations into one centralized location.One example of this integration is Trump Talk, which allows volunteers to place voter contact calls from the safety and comfort of their own homes.If you’re familiar with campaigning, you know that such integration of all operations never happens. This is just another example of Team Trump reshaping presidential politics through an unprecedented digital operation.Receive Points & Rewards Along the WayAll of the above activities on the Trump app are gamified. This means supporters can receive points if they sign-up for virtual events, share the app with their friends, make calls, or re-share content.Our supporters know how to help us find more supporters and they are rewarded for doing just that. It’s engaging, scalable, fun, and improves our Republican Party’s data along the way.Trump Army Data Goes into Over-drive into 2020While we build our data and simultaneously recruit new supporters to join our Campaign—our competitors simply do not have the time or the ability to replicate this app.First, their candidate is not Donald Trump, who is a disruptor fueling the record-breaking enthusiasm and historic support for our campaign. Second, the Trump app was developed over the past 4 years and built on the Republican National Committee’s voter file, which was developed and perfected years prior. This enables us to marry the information between the Trump app and our enormous voter file, which now includes more than 200 million voters. This Republican data is only getting bigger and better by the day, thanks to the great teamwork between the Trump Campaign and the RNC, led by Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and Co-Chair Tommy Hicks.By contrast, the DNC and Democrats never integrated their data like Team Trump and the Republicans.With President Trump’s loyal supporters now engaging directly with our new groundbreaking app, we are truly an unstoppable juggernaut. The Republican Party and Trump Campaign are not slowing down heading into November. We are doing everything in our power to Keep America Great.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/parscale-pence-coronavirus-trump-team-app/
22,Politics,EXCLUSIVE: Chinese State Media Changes Columnist’s Fake Bio After National Pulse Exposé,"Chinese state media outlet China Global Television Network (CGTN) has been forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a National Pulse exposé into “security analyst” Hannan Hussain and his fraudulent credentials from the London School of Economics.Hussain authored an article “here’s why Steve Bannon can’t be trusted,” using mainstream media tactics to smear the former White House Chief strategist, War Room: Pandemic podcast host, and staunch Chinese Communist Party critic, part of Chinese state media outlets – controlled entirely by the CCP – coordinated assault against Bannon.The National Pulse first reported on the story to highlight how the CCP was taking aim at Bannon, but later discovered that one of the authors they were using to do so, had a fake bio.CGTN banked on Hussain’s alleged ties to the prestigious university to grant credibility to his CCP puff piece; establishment media wouldn’t report on it, so The National Pulse picked up their slack.His bio for the article “Hannan Hussain is a security analyst at the London School of Economics – South Asia Centre, and an author” was debunked by the LSE itself: “Hussain is not a ‘Security Analyst’ with LSE South Asia Centre nor does he hold any other position at LSE. The position of ‘Security Analyst’ does not even exist at LSE. Mr Hussain has merely published two blog posts previously, as have hundreds of other individuals.”@HannanHussain7 is not a 'Security Analyst' with LSE South Asia Centre nor does he hold any other position at LSE. The position of ‘Security Analyst’ does not even exist @SAsiaLSE. Mr Hussain has merely published two blog posts previously, as have hundreds of other individuals.— SouthAsia@LSE (@SAsiaLSE) May 4, 2020And in Hussain’s most recent article “what the DHS report doesn’t tell,” attempts to debunk US officials’ report that the CCP covered up the coronavirus outbreak, chiefly to stockpile medical supplies – with no source links – his bio has been updated to reflect the exposé: “Hannan Hussain is an Assistant Researcher at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, and an author. He is also an international affairs commentator for The Diplomat, a leading foreign policy magazine based in Washington”:However, given CGTN and Hussain’s track record, we’re now investigating the newly alleged positions.While CGTN has yet to go back to his previously published works or author page and make the adjustment, it’s clear CGTN – a registered foreign agent with distribution in over 100 countries – has taken note of our reporting.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/chinese-media-fake-bio-hannan-hussain/
23,Politics,"EXCLUSIVE: ‘Political Analyst’ Tom Fowdy is A CCP ‘Consultant’, Propagandist, and ‘Works With’ North Korea?","A National Pulse investigation has revealed a concerted campaign of misinformation and lies peddled by Western-based “analysts” keen to promote the Chinese Communist Party’s line, and attack those intent on holding the brutal Chinese dictatorship to account.Tom Fowdy, a British political analyst with a vast portfolio of pro-Chinese Communist Party content in Chinese state media, insists he has no affiliation with the CCP, hastily blocking National Pulse reporters and editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam for questioning him about the connection. A deep dive into his past and present commitments suggests otherwise.Fowdy recently penned an op-ed entitled “Steve Bannon: A Modern Day Demagogue” for China Global Television Network (CGTN), part of Chinese state media’s broader smear campaign against the former White House Chief Strategist, War Room: Pandemic podcast host, and ardent CCP critic.The outlet Fowdy frequently writes for is a registered foreign agent, operating under the auspices of the CCP.The article swiftly followed CGTN publishing another Bannon hit piece, “Here’s why Steve Bannon can’t be trusted,” by author Hannan Hussain who faked credentials as a “security analyst” at the London School of Economics’ South Asia Centre:When asked on Tuesday about the nature of his affiliation with the CCP, Tom Fowdy lashed out emotionally at critics, and instead of answering basic questions, blocked dozens of Twitter users calling for transparency.Soon after, Fowdy locked his account for several hours.But Fowdy’s status as a de facto Chinese Communist Party propaganda mouthpiece is well-documented and doesn’t even require access to his Twitter to piece together.While Fowdy, who’s lived in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, claims his arrangement with Chinese state media outlets is “not actually a contracted or formal job,” his own LinkedIn suggests otherwise.At CGTN, Fowdy claims the title of “columnist,” but his work for the organization is not limited to just writing over 200 CCP puff pieces: he helps amplify the outlet’s reach.He lists himself as a consultant for the outlet on “social media strategies.”Fowdy’s participation also isn’t limited to “voluntary op-eds,” and social media consultancy. He’s produced multiple videos with CGTN with “political analyst” as his biography.In the video “Is America really losing on trade?” Fowdy echoes CCP talking points, alleging President Trump’s tariffs harm Americans. He goes so far as to make the risible claim that Americans benefit from the massive trade deficit with China.China’s exploitative trade practices disproportionately disadvantage working-class Americans unable to compete with cheap labor and low production costs, hemorrhaging nearly four million jobs in less than two decades and contributing to the massive opioid epidemic in the U.S.In another video for CGTN, Fowdy disparages Hong Kong’s democracy protestors who seek freedom from the Chinese Communist Regime.Fowdy justifies Chinese state-sanctioned law enforcers who cracked down on the protests, stating:“Local authorities cannot be expected to concede on legitimate matters of law enforcement and holding those who have pursued violence and criminal activities to account. This is not political oppression.”“The general public must become more accepting of Hong Kong’s status as a part of China in a pragmatic way. The principle of ‘One Country’ must be upheld as an unconditional line for dialogue.”The “One Country” doctrine Fowdy promotes is part of the CCP’s justification for the violence and repression it inflicts on Taiwan and minority groups, for the policy supports the regime’s belief it wields complete and unchallengeable imperial authority.And Fowdy’s written commentary is equally egregious.In multiple CGTN pieces, Fowdy criticizes people “waging a defamatory campaign against Huawei.”In reality, Huawei is a CCP-affiliated telecommunications equipment giant. Founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a Chinese Communist Party member and former military officer in the People’s Liberation Army, Huawei’s rise stemmed from generous CCP backing.Huawei poses “massive security and privacy risks. With 5G capabilities, the CCP could use Huawei to steal private or proprietary information or use kill switches to disrupt critical future applications like electrical grids” according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Despite this, “Consumers who enjoy and appreciate the products of Huawei should not allow Cold War opportunism to get in the way of their experience,” according to Fowdy.Fowdy has also likened the CCP’s well-documented repression of Uyghurs as “a great deal of misunderstanding, hysteria, and deliberate opportunism being placed on the issue by some Western elites.”He’s cast efforts to remove Confucius Institutes from American campuses as a misguided “war,” insisting that the CCP-funded entity – a trojan horse for propaganda – which has admitted to wanting to introduce Chinese “morality and values” into American schools refrains from “political subversion, spread ideology or attempt to influence local politics.”And Fowdy uses additional Chinese state media platforms to simp for the CCP.Penning several pieces for Global Times, a daily tabloid which is part of the CCP’s People’s Daily newspaper, he purports that “ideological narcissism causes heavy losses to West amid outbreak” while glorifying the CCP’s response:“Beijing would be effectively declaring victory, while the West descended slowly into a state of panic.”He also insists the “UK needs to cool anti-China rhetoric.”Fowdy’s works entitled “China’s key role will not go away” and “Pompeo weaponizes normal exchanges” were published at the state-owned outlet China Daily, and China Plus has also shared his anti-Trump content: “as midterms approach, Trump weaponizes migrant fearmongering” and “Far-right anti-Semitism is rising in US.”He’s even taken his analysis on “how China got to zero new domestic COVID-19 cases” to a Nigerian newspaper and the Southern African Times, in line with Xi Jinping’s 2016 declaration that “Wherever the readers are, wherever the viewers are, that is where propaganda reports must extend their tentacles.”But his CCP ties run much deeper than commentary.Fowdy claims he was a marketing intern at Beijing-based Hongzhou Learning, a company which has “achieved support from the Beijing Foreign Affairs Office” since it carries out the CCP’s “Belt and Road” policy, specifically facilitating “the cooperation and exchanges between Chinese universities and the Universities along belt and road countries”In other words, Fowdy was part of a team assisting the CCP’s message by amplifying the reach of the program.Tom Fowdy’s other business dealings are equally questionable.As the founder of “Visit North Korea” – a travel agency for those who want to visit the communist country – Fowdy apparently helped organize trips for tourists and study-abroad programs for students.The company’s blog, which Fowdy contributes to, has posted articles including “Five extremely annoying things in the UK you won’t miss whilst visiting North Korea,” “Seven places in Britain that are scarier to Visit than North Korea,” and “Five reasons North Korea is a better holiday destination than Spain.”The blog even asserts:“The leadership of North Korea is poorly understood in Western political discourse. Kim Jong Un and his predecessors are vilified, mocked and dismissed with the usual western buzzwords of “dictator”, “brutal”, “despot”, “madman” and so on. When faced with the observation that many people in North Korea happen to revere the leadership, again westerners dismiss it as “propaganda”, “an act”, “brainwashing” or so on, as the average western assumes it is impossible they can be in any way legitimate.”In an interview with Mandatory Redistribution Party, which describes itself as publishing “radical left interviews,” Fowdy admitted that while the company is “not owned by [North Korea], but you have to work in correspondence with them.”Fowdy also says he’s trying to “myth bust” many Western conceptions about the North Korean regime, suggesting the country should be addressed in “a more objective and less antagonistic light.”“The world could be a better place through visiting North Korea,” he adds.The interview gets even more absurd: he justifies North Korea’s quest for nuclear weapons and declares that “China is very misunderstood by the West.”The company’s Twitter account peddles the same narrative:This arcade game in a North Korean kindergarten involves shooting pirates, except the pirates are Americans!#DPRK #Northkorea #visitnorthkorea #pyongyang #visitdprk #pyongyang pic.twitter.com/03F6R0GMcB— Visit North Korea (@VisitDPRK) May 2, 2020Fowdy also spearheaded a controversial initiative to bring his hometown’s soccer team to North Korea, which many rightfully condemned as enabling the brutal North Korean regime.He was even listed as the team’s official contact.Despite these connections, the CCP touts him as a “British political and international relations Analyst,” certainly an interesting euphemism for propagandist, consultant, Belt and Road initiative enabler, and North Korea simp.In a comment not sent to the National Pulse, but issued on his Twitter account, Tom Fowdy insisted: “My work is motivated by a desire to promote an objective, nuanced view into China and a passionate urge to combat far-right conveyors of fake news such as Raheem [Kassam, Editor of the National Pulse].”Those “objective, nuanced views” just happen to be commissioned and promoted by the Communist Party of China.The National Pulse will continue to expose CCP propagandists and their bedfellows.Kinglsey Cortes and Corby King contributed to this report.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/tom-fowdy-ccp-north-korea/

Sinai Hospital.The pressure to remove them was spearheaded by Councilman Corey Johnson (D) alongside New York’s Reclaim Pride Coalition, and The New York City Commission on Human Rights – all hardline LGBT activists.“It is time for Samaritan’s Purse to leave NYC. This group, led by the notoriously bigoted, hate-spewing Franklin Graham, came at a time when our city couldn’t in good conscience turn away any offer of help. That time has passed,” Johnson tweeted Saturday.Translation: we don’t like you and we don’t want you here, but we need you so you can stay. After we are done using you, we’ll continue to bad mouth you on the way out.My statement on Samaritan's Purse:It is time for Samaritan's Purse to leave NYC. This group, led by the notoriously bigoted, hate-spewing Franklin Graham, came at a time when our city couldn't in good conscience turn away any offer of help. That time has passed. 1/— NYC Council Speaker Corey Johnson (@NYCSpeakerCoJo) May 1, 2020Since 1970, Samaritan’s Purse has helped those who have been impacted by war, poverty, famine, and natural disasters.
Whether it would be treating Ebola patients in West Africa, Syrian refugees in Iraq, earthquake victims in Ecuador, tornado victims in Tennessee, or Italians facing the coronavirus.When asked why, the reply never changes.“Why did you come? ” asks its website. “The answer is always the same: ‘We have come to help you in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ'”.The organization has been scrutinized by the LGBTQ community for their belief in the sanctity of life, traditional marriage and their support for President Trump.It was obvious that the ultra progressive NYC wouldn’t welcome them with open arms.Even Dr. Elliott Tenpenny, who led the team, said in an interview with the NY Post: “This is honestly the most improbable place we’ve ever been… I never would have guessed we’d come to New York City with something like this. But New York never thought it would be dealing with a pandemic, either.”Despite the hurdles they would have to overcome, they took care of business and set up shop armed with a team of 70 health care workers from around the country and four trailers full of necessities including tents, beds, personal protective equipment and 10 ventilators for the most seriously ill patients.Even with a record of never turning away a person in need, they were made to sign a waiver that they wouldn’t exclude anybody at the insistence of Democratic NYC mayor Bill DeBlasio.According to Graham: “…we have never asked any of the millions of people we have served to subscribe to anything. In other words, as a religious charity, while we lawfully hire staff who share our Christian beliefs, we do not discriminate in who we serve”.“Our Christian faith compels us — like the biblical Good Samaritan — to love and serve everyone in need, regardless of their faith or background.”You would think volunteers who came to the epicenter of the virus, putting themselves in harms way, risking their lives in the process, all to help their fellow man would be appreciated and not condemned.But it wasn’t to be.Instead they were protested and slandered, causing Graham to question the obvious: “It seems tone-deaf to be attacking our religious conviction about marriage at the very moment thousands of New Yorkers are fighting for their lives.”As tone deaf it was as it didn’t stop activists like Jay W. Walker of the Reclaim Pride Coalition to express his confusion on the matter.“How was this group ever considered to bring their hatred and their vitriol into our city‘?”Perhaps if Mr.Walker wants to see “hatred” and “vitriol”, he should take a look in the mirror.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/lgbt-samaritans-purse-nyc/
25,Politics,"U.S. Socialists Pander to Communist China, Warns Vietnamese Refugee","Socialism is viewed the most favorably amongst Millennials and Generation Z: 51 percent hold a favorable view of capitalism, while an unsettling 49 percent view socialism favorably, according to a recent Gallup poll.“The radical left often operates outside of reality,” says Morgan Zegers, founder of Young Americans Against Socialism (YAAS). Socialists “reject basic facts and distort history to push their narrative onto innocent, well-intentioned young minds.”“In true leftist fashion, America’s socialists are now pandering to communist China and pushing for the nationalization of major industries during a pandemic crisis,” Zegers explains.Commie propaganda is running amuck in the era of COVID-19. And the Left loves to deny basic facts. But first-hand testimony shines an UNDENIABLE light of truth on the realities of socialism and communism. New @YAAS_America video coming today from a survivor of communism.— Morgan Zegers (@MorganZegers) May 5, 2020In an effort to push back against socialist and communist disinformation, Zegers says her organization is “equipping our peers with the intellectual ammunition required to reject the lies of the left. We are painting a vivid picture of truth in the minds of young Americans by telling the stories of survivors of socialism and communism.”“The truth found in first-hand testimony from these survivors is undeniable,” she says. “These stories will change our generation’s perspective on socialism for good.”In a video released by YAAS on Tuesday, Amy Phan tells the story of her life under and escape from communist Vietnam.“My dad told my mom, ‘we can’t have a future in Vietnam… We have to leave Vietnam because we will die in the hands of the communists.’” Phan recalled.“Before the communist regime took over, [Vietnam] was beautiful and nice,” she explained. “ My dad and mom, each time they fished, they had enough to provide for the family and put a roof over our head. But once the communists took over, everything that they fished they had to give to the communists, the government. If they don’t do it, [the communists] make an example of them [and] bury them alive.”Phan escaped Vietnam in 1984 when she and her family hid in the bottom of her father’s fishing boat. After being taken in by a German oil tanker, they were sent to a refugee camp in Thailand, then the Philippines. All the while seeking asylum in the United States.Eventually, Amy Phan became a United States citizen, and enjoys the merits of a capitalist economy: she’s a successful small business owner.“Right now in America we still have the freedom. We still have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to bear arms. We have the freedom to be entrepreneurs, freedom to free market [sic], freedom to do everything. And everything we make, we keep. Not like North Korea’s dictatorship; or China, the communist regime; or Vietnam; or Venezuela’s socialism.”“I experienced it once already. I’ve seen women and children getting raped and thrown overboard on a fishing boat. I’ve seen people die because of starvation, they are eating flesh to survive,” she remembered the horrors of living under communism.“This country is great because of our Constitution. So we have to fight and we have to preserve that. If we don’t we will lose it all.” Phan asserts that “we cannot have communism that comes in and destroys the nation like this.”",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/yaas-communist-china/
26,Politics,Why is the Chinese Communist Party Targeting Steve Bannon? Because He’s Right About Them.,"There are few entities in geopolitics that practice information warfare as fervently and efficiently as the Chinese Communist Party.In order to assist their efforts of achieving political goals by bending information and distorting the truth, the CCP has an entire network of media assets to flood airwaves and every other medium with their carefully crafted narratives.They’re masters of propaganda, and they’ve found a new target, former White House Chief Strategist and renowned CCP-hawk Stephen K. Bannon.The opening salvo against Bannon came courtesy of this article on the China Global Television Network’s website.The article talks about how Bannon is a “known far-right nationalist” who should be dismissed, because he’s always frothing at the mouth about China. Immediately after, the writer of the piece claims Bannon is only frothing at the mouth about China because he’s looking to recapture some lost relevance.If this propaganda is to be believed, Bannon is attempting to gain relevance by doing exactly what he was doing upon allegedly losing this relevance. Obviously, that makes no sense. As always with propaganda, making sense isn’t the goal.The next piece of the attack came courtesy of Xinhuanet, when the CCP’s chosen mouthpiece opened his article by calling Bannon a “proven far-right fringe extremist”. Are you detecting a pattern? It almost sounds like coordination, doesn’t it?And yet, no word from CNN and others about “foreign intervention” in American politics. But more of that another time.The content of the Xinhua is broadly meaningless. Again, not the point.Their goal is to flood the zone with so much misinformation that no one really knows what to believe anymore. Something the left accused Russia of with scarcely as much evidence as there already is for CCP agitprop.The most recent attack on Bannon came from China Central TV’s website itself.In the article, Bannon is labeled as an “ultra-right political strategist” who “has always held aggressive far-right political views, regularly advocating racism and xenophobia”.Not only is the pattern holding, but now it’s evolving.Rather than merely dismiss Bannon as “far-right” or “alt-right” or even “ultra-mega-super-right-wing”, they’ve upgraded to baldly lying, claiming that Bannon is some champion of racists. Remember, this is a man who has called ethno-nationalists “losers”. Some racist!Again, the goal of propaganda isn’t to make sense.The goal of propaganda is to staple an unfavorable narrative to the target, discrediting their words and simultaneously painting yourself as the sympathetic victim of underserved ire.The recent attempt maybe rushed and hamfisted, but if not for the hawks, it might be effective. Especially as social media platforms in the West seem reluctant to pull down Chinese propaganda – learning no lessons from the whole “Russian bot” debacle.By labeling Bannon as “far right” and a bunch of comical derivatives of the same concept, the CCP is hoping to enlist the Left into the propaganda fight by duping the useful idiots into thinking China is fighting the same political war with Bannon that the American Left is.That couldn’t be further from the truth.Bannon has launched an aggressive and relentless assault on the reputation of the CCP since his career in politics began, and he’s done that because the CCP is the world’s most consistent violator of human rights, and the most destructive political force in world history.The truth of their villany has flown under the radar, and avoided the scrutiny of the American people. But after their malicious actions to toss the world into a global pandemic, the eyes of the American people are wide open.The CCP is firing back at Bannon now, and the force behind their retaliation exposes their desperation.Those three articles came within hours of each other. It is part of a coordinated barrage. America’s most powerful foreign adversary is frantically targeting one political commentator. Their smears inadvertently describe their motive. By calling Bannon every synonym of “more-right-than-usual” that they can think of, they tacitly admit that America’s right-wing has transformed into a political body capable of doing tremendous damage to the world’s most oppressive and malevolent regime.The CCP realizes that American nationalism is the political philosophy most responsible for waking the country up and exposing the evil of China’s communist regime. One of their propagandists coyly admits to this fact by stating in part: “The biggest threat facing the U.S. is not the new virus, but rather right-wing populists who are intent on creating trouble with their strain of political virus.”This is a classic case of projection on display from the propagandist.“Right-wing populists” aren’t a threat to America. But they are the biggest threat that China has faced down since the CCP’s rise to power. It was the populist movement that originally adopted the idea of confronting China’s exploitative trade practices, and now it’s the rest of the country adopting that necessary policy into their own political agendas.That necessary policy happens to be a large first-step towards the economic destruction of the CCP. And their recent volley of propaganda is proof positive that those policies are making the CCP sweat.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/chinese-communist-party-targeting-steve-bannon/
27,Politics,"EXCLUSIVE: California Professor Blasts Trump, Insists ‘We Can’t Stop China’s Rise’ In Propaganda Articles For Chinese State Media","Chapman University Professor and de facto Chinese Communist Party propagandist Dr. Jia Wenshan blamed President Trump for the novel coronavirus, alleging he’s a “white supremacist” that must be “swept into the basket of history” in an op-ed for the state-run Chinese media outlet China Global Television Network.While Jia is a professor of communications at the California-based school, he also retains an affiliation with several China-based institutions. He’s an adjunct professor at Shandong University, a research fellow at Renmin University’s National Academy for Development and Strategy, and a senior fellow at the CCP-linked Center for China and Globalization.And he’s consistently applauded China’s ascent to power.In fact, he coined the awkward term “Chiglobalization” in 2009, which he defines as “the increasing global relevance, global presence, global influence, and global leadership of China.” He even authored the book “Greater China in an Era of Globalization.” Given President Trump’s firm rejection of the “false song of globalism” and aptitude for preventing China’s continued siphoning of American jobs, Jia is no fan of his.In Jia’s latest tirade against the president, an op-ed entitled “The Trump Administration Is Responsible For The Triple Pandemics” for state-owned outlet CGTN, he pins the virus itself, ensuing economic fallout, and alleged escalation of racism on President Trump.“Removal of Trumpism would be an effective cure to the tri-calamities,” he summarizes.Jia rebukes President Trump’s virus response, noting it only “appease[s] and please[s] populists and White supremacists by fanning racial hatred against people of Asian descent.”“The Trump administration is characterized by White supremacy and xenophobia,” he rationalizes.And President Trump’s failures transcend coronavirus: his administration has “failed to make America great again. Instead, it has made America decline again, politically, economically and culturally.”Jia’s solution?“The U.S. and the world would be much better off without the Trump administration’s ideology. To end the triple crises, it must be swept into the basket of history,” Jia proposes.The article is not out of line with his past work: Jia has glorified how China is “shifting from a participant to a leader of the new world order,” declared the CCP’s Belt and Road Initiative “good for the world,” and proclaimed the “US can’t stop China’s rise all of the time.”He even criticized President Trump’s State of the Union address, alleging “the State of the Union is not strong, grudgingly strong, or partially strong” which could be mended if “the populist, protectionist, unilateral policies are stopped.”In response to the National Pulse’s request for comment, Chapman University’s Vice President of Strategic Marketing and Communications responded: “Chapman University is firmly committed to the principles of academic freedom and free speech.”While freedom of speech is a paramount and fleeting luxury on American college campuses, given the suspicious nature of CCP involvement and investment in American institutions and Xi’s 2016 diktat that “wherever the readers are, wherever the viewers are, that is where propaganda reports must extend their tentacles,” there’s a solid chance that pro-China, anti-Trump commentary isn’t “free speech” but rather CCP-funded propaganda.And narratives like Jia’s help prop up the CCP, a communist regime with no reverence for the freedom of speech.This report follows House Republicans launching an investigation into the CCP’s infiltration into American schools, in addition to the countless instances of intellectual property theft and Confucius Institute-sponsored propaganda campaigns.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/prof-claims-trump-responsible/
28,Politics,EXCLUSIVE: Chinese Propaganda Attacking Steve Bannon Written by Fake ‘Security Analyst’ With Fraudulent Credentials,"CGTN.com, the official website for China’s Global Television Network, published a propaganda piece on Monday bashing former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.The article’s author appears to have faked the credentials of “Security Analyst” at the London School of Economics.Bannon has berated and exposed the Chinese Communist Party for their egregious human rights record, exploitative trade practices, and – most recently – their efforts to conceal the novel coronavirus from the world. “I think the world’s going to hold them in judgment, and that judgment is not going to be very pretty. They owe trillions, if not tens of trillions of dollars,” Bannon said on CNBC’s Squawk Box.In a piece for CGTN, Hannan Hussain – who claimed to be a security analyst at the London School of Economics’ South Asia Centre – wrote: “Contrary to Bannon’s claims, there are no trillions up for grabs, because Washington’s reckless handling of the pandemic – from suppression of information to a coordinated political campaign against China – has eclipsed the credibility of the serving administration.”The London School of Economics told The National Pulse in a statement post-publication of the original story:Mr Hussain is not a ‘Security Analyst’ with LSE South Asia Centre nor does he hold any other position at LSE. The position of ‘Security Analyst’ does not even exist at our Centre.Hussain’s propaganda piece for the Chinese Communist Party’s state-sanctioned news outlet predictably labels Steve Bannon a xenophobe, racist, etc. The piece also notes that some American academics, whom Hussain calls “lifelong threats to the likes of Bannon,” have disparaged Bannon’s reparations argument. As much as he hopes, Hussain is not unique. For decades, bureaucrats in Washington, Wall Street corporatists, and intellectual elites at institutional universities like Harvard have kowtowed to China’s brutal communist regime. Hussain appears to have published two blogs with the LSE in the past, but does not hold a position in the university.Even another of Hussain’s publishers – The Diplomat magazine – has listed China Central Television (CCTV) as “long standing weapon in Beijing’s arsenal of repression”.Do your editors @Diplomat_APAC know you're writing propaganda pieces for the ""long standing weapon in Beijing's arsenal of repression""? pic.twitter.com/GLwBW3l12j— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) May 4, 2020When asked to comment on his work for the Chinese Communist Party, Hussein blocked National Pulse editor Raheem Kassam.Preliminary US investigations indicate that, after learning of the possible pandemic, the Chinese government hid the information from the Chinese people for six days and allowed the city of Wuhan to host a mass banquet as millions began traveling for Lunar New Year celebrations. President Xi Jinping did not warn the Chinese people of the outbreak until the seventh day, January 20th. By this time, more than 3,000 people had already been infected.A leaked dossier from the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance – including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand – obtained exclusively by Australia’s Daily Telegraph newspaper finds that the Chinese Communist Party intentionally hid or destroyed evidence pertaining to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The report also highlights China’s suppression of evidence regarding the outbreak – including, but not limited to, bleaching wet market stalls, censoring evidence of asymptomatic carriers, and refusing to accommodate sample requests from other countries. Senior US intelligence officials told Fox News that the reports of the dossier are consistent with United States investigations into the origins of the outbreak. “I’ve been heartened to see Australia, other countries joining us, demanding an investigation, because while we know this started in Wuhan, China, we don’t yet know from where it started,” United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. “And in spite of our best efforts to get experts on the ground, they continue to try and hide and obfuscate.” Last Thursday, April 30th, President Trump also confirmed that he had personally seen intelligence linking the Wuhan Institute of Virology to the origin of the virus. When asked to elaborate, President Trump said: “I can’t tell you that, I’m not allowed to tell you that.” The Chinese Communist Party’s refusal to include outside actors in their investigations into the origins and spread of the novel coronavirus prove China-hawks like Steve Bannon are right to refer to the global pandemic as China’s “biological Chernobyl.”The 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster and USSR’s subsequent cover-up resulted in the endangerment of European populations and ultimately devastating loss of life. China’s botched response to the novel coronavirus pandemic seems to evidence Mark Twain’s famous maxim: “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Especially when it comes to communist regimes. This much we know: CCP running dogs like Hussain are on the wrong side of history. This article has been updated to reflect the statement by the London School of Economics asserting Mr Hussain holds no position there.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/chinas-global-television-network-steve-bannon-cant-be-trusted/
29,Politics,REVEALED: Iowa Republican Miller-Meeks Said She Is ‘Pro-Choice’,"Iowa Republican primary candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks’ declared she was “pro-choice” in 2018, the latest evidence to corroborate her weak record on abortion.It’s further proof that Miller-Meeks’ alleged pro-life stance is mere politicking for votes, clarifying why voters in Iowa can’t trust the three-time congressional race loser to protect the unborn.“I am pro-choice, but it’s a very sensitive issue,” she revealed at a 2018 Ottumwa League of Women Voters candidate forum.The forum centered on if Miller-Meeks or her primary challenger would repeal a bill banning abortions in light of fetal heartbeat detection.“Ultimately as a doctor and a healthcare provider, I think these are decisions that are best left to providers, to doctors and to patients. I don’t want the government in my healthcare decisions,” she declared, leaving the door wide open for terminating a baby’s life even it has a heartbeat.Miller-Meeks’ stance doesn’t come as a shock: in an earlier interview, she similarly responded that she supported “abortion rights” up to 12 weeks, nearly six weeks after a heartbeat is detected.The interviewer asks: “Abortion rights? There’s no like set week? Like number? Like 12 weeks, 20 weeks?”“From the medical standpoint, between six and 12,” Miller-Meeks responds.And in 2008, Miller-Meeks was called a “great pretender” by Iowa Right to Life.Despite her long pro-choice track record, Miller-Meeks’ campaign responded to the allegations, contending she “misspoke”: “Senator Miller-Meeks was speaking to the point that she is a pro-life Catholic when it came to her mind that some notable Catholic elected leaders are pro-choice. That prompted her to misspeak. As a physician, she was emphasizing her belief that, regardless of the medical condition being discussed, doctor-patient conversations need to be private and free of government intervention.”If Miller-Meeks’ pro-life convictions were genuine, there’d be no chance of making this unforced error.On abortion, an issue of paramount significance that Democrats and feminist activists defend relentlessly, Congress needs all the pro-life advocates in can get. And Miller-Meeks has demonstrated consistently she’s not up to task.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/miller-meeks-pro-choice-iowa/
30,Politics,London Mayor Sadiq Khan Praises Iran’s Coronavirus Response As Superior to UK,"London Mayor Sadiq Khan extolled Iran’s coronavirus response as superior to the United Kingdom’s, giving ammunition to the country’s cover up of its disastrous and ineffective control efforts.The infamous President Trump hater and “diversity is our strength” peddler remarked “it appears that Tehran is a bit ahead of us in relation to the virus and how to respond to it,” in a recent video call with Tehran Mayor Pirouz Hanachi.“I congratulate the Iranian officials for this,” he added; the same officials who perpetuate a regime that consistently tramples on freedoms paramount to the West, neglects human rights, and abuses the rule of law.Tehran has seized on the messaging, seeing it as a propaganda coup.Why is @SadiqKhan asking Iran for advice? A nation that hijacked multiple British oil vessels less than a year ago? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/Tn8VC0graN— Turning Point UK (@TPointUK) April 26, 2020Iranian state-owned media had a field day with his positive comments, weaponizing them as part of an elaborate cover up of Iran’s deeply flawed coronavirus response.According to experts, dissidents, and even the country’s own health ministry and parliament, there’s a stark disparity between the reported number of coronavirus deaths and reality. And the Iranian regime had a significant hand in spawning cases: despite warnings of the coronavirus, the regime still organized mass gatherings – compulsory for government employees – in late February. Parliamentary elections later that month presented another hot bed for the virus to easily spread.And these decisions catalyzed a massive death toll. The country’s burial pits are “so vast they’re visible from space.”Accordingly, the Iranian regime is on overdrive to suppress their missteps, even arresting thousands of citizens for “spreading rumors about coronavirus.” The state-dominated media sphere plays an integral role in the cover up, and Khan played into their hands.The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting corporation-affiliated PressTV touted Kahn’s comments, using “Iran more successful in coronavirus fight than UK” as a headline.Similarly, his comments gave the Tehran Times license to run the story, “Tehran is ahead of [UK] in coronavirus battle.” And Hamshahri Online also pushed how “Tehran is ahead of London against Corona.”And this narrative is wildly incorrect: Iran was hesitant to adopt lockdown policies and lifted their scant restrictions in early April while the United Kingdom adopted comprehensive lockdown and social distancing measures that remain in effect and accomplished unprecedented levels of testing with considerably more transparency. Meanwhile, Khan is more than eager to attack President Trump, calling him a “disgrace” for using the term “Chinese virus.” He’s willing to help prop up an authoritarian, Islamic theocracy and trigger happy to degrade the US and UK’s “special relationship” in the name of political correctness and Trump Derangement Syndrome.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/khan-iran-response/
31,Politics,Bill Hagerty Maxed Out Donations To John McCain At Peak Of Trump Feud,"Tennessee Senate wannabe Bill Hagerty donated to John McCain’s SuperPAC at the peak of the late Senator’s feud with then-candidate Trump, symbolic of Hagerty’s establishment Republican views he’s now trying to conceal.It’s the latest evidence proving the Romney and Bush campaign staffer’s sudden pro-Trump, anti-establishment shift is not rooted in support for the president’s populist agenda but rather calculated for votes.The news is in addition to the fact Hagerty’s first choice in the 2016 presidential race was Jeb Bush, followed by Marco Rubio, and he worked for Never Trump Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, using his position to garner favors from the establishment politicians.While the forces conspiring to undermine candidate Trump were immeasurable, the notorious feud with McCain epitomized the Trump vs. Republican establishment civil war.Focused chiefly on immigration and foreign policy differences, failed GOP presidential candidate McCain rebuked Trump from the outset, even refusing to attend the Republican National Convention as Trump cruised to victory as the party’s nominee.While the feud ebbed and flowed, it hit one of its peaks in mid-2016. Right when Hagerty appeared to donate to McCain’s personal PAC.When President Trump was looking for support against the establishment Hagerty purports to be against, Hagerty helped fund the figurehead orchestrating the attacks: he donated the maximum amount possible to the Friends of John McCain PAC on June 29th, 2016 according to Federal Election Commission records:The PAC – or “political action committee” – was McCain’s slush fund for his Senate campaign, meaning Hagerty was helping to ensure McCain’s re-election, placing yet another Trump foe in the Senate and giving him a broader platform to bash the president.I’s not even the first time Hagerty helped him: he served on McCain’s 2008 Presidential Transition Team.Hagerty eventually donated $5,400 to two Trump campaign super PACS over two months after his McCain-emboldening donation.Too little, too late.It’s abundantly clear: Hagerty is an establishment Republican through and through, and his newfound pro-Trump convictions are merely a ploy.President Trump has come so far in his quest to retrofit the Republican party to represent working Americans – the antithesis of the McCain ilk – and sending Hagerty to Washington would be a major step back.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/hagerty-mccain-never-trump/

During her inaugural podium briefing, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany did not disappoint, handling her former colleagues in the media with grace and ease.Not only was this the first briefing held by McEnany since she assumed office, but it is the first podium briefing the White House has had in over a year.“I will never lie to you. You have my word on that,” she told reporters and the American people.“I am consistently with [Trump], absorbing his thinking, and it’s my mission to bring you the mindset of the president and deliver those facts.”During her half hour behind the podium, McEnany tackled many pressing and controversial issues in the media today, including China, General Flynn, Tara Reade’s sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden, and even the media coverage itself.Concise, thoughtful, and well prepared from @kayleighmcenany.— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) May 1, 2020As regards China, the Press Secretary criticized how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) handled the COVID-19 outbreak.“It’s no secret that China mishandled the situation,” she asserted, explaining how China “shut down the lab for ‘rectification,’ they’ve slow-walked information on a human to human transmission alongside the World Health Organization, and didn’t let the U.S. investigators in at a very important time.” McEnany added how China “did not share the genetic sequence [of the virus] until a professor in Shanghai did so on his own.”“So we take displeasure with China’s actions,” she concluded.China is not the only one with whom McEnany expressed ‘displeasure’.“There is a case of injustice that has yet to be brought up today, and I certainly would like to bring it up… What we’ve all learned from [General Flynn’s case] should scare every American citizen,” she said, as new evidence is coming to light that not only exonerates the former Trump advisor but incriminates former top ranking FBI officials, such as James Comey and Andrew McCabe.Outlining the case, McEnany explained: “You had Jim Comey admitting in December of last year that he violated a protocol by directing agents to confront Flynn, something that he ‘wouldn’t have gotten away with under previous administrations.’ The FBI told Flynn he didn’t need a lawyer when they came to meet with him. McCabe told FBI agents that he didn’t think Flynn was lying.”“And all of that information we’ve learned over the last few months and years culminates in the fact that we have a handwritten FBI note that says ‘we need to get Flynn to lie and get him fired.’”“There was an unfair target on the back of General Michael Flynn.” She reaffirmed: “It should concern every American anytime there’s a partisan pursuit of an individual, and…at least those questions are raised with regard to General Michael Flynn, an honorable man who served his country.”McEnany pushed back on the Democrats for similarly treating Justice Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court nomination when asked about the President saying Reade’s allegation against Biden is “far more compelling with anything they had with respect to Brett Kavanaugh.”“I think it was a grave miscarriage of justice what happened with Justice Brett Kavanaugh.,” she said. “There’s no need for me to bring up some of the salacious, awful, and un-verifiably false allegations that were made against Justice Kavanaugh.”Moreover she declared that it “was an embarrassment for the Democrat party to have dragged the name of a very respectable man through the mud like that.”True Statement by @PressSec pic.twitter.com/FoPWBdyd9d— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 1, 2020The Press Secretary also responded directly to the sexual assault allegations against 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden.“[The White House is] pleased the former vice president has decided to go on the record,” she said. “It took him, what, less than 16 hours to follow the advice of the president and go on record and publicly address those claims.”Reporters in the room quickly pivoted from Biden to Trump when it came to sexual assault allegations.“The President has swiftly denied all of these allegations that were raised four years ago,” McEnany responded to a question about past accusations made against the President..@PressSec @KayleighMcEnany: ""Leave it to the media to really take an issue about the former Vice President and turn it on the President."" pic.twitter.com/QViKObE3b6— The Hill (@thehill) May 1, 2020“He has always told the truth on these issues, he’s denied them immediately, and you’re bringing up issues, like I said, from four years ago that were asked and answered. And the American people had their say on the matter when they elected President Trump as President of the United States.”“Leave it to the media to really take an issue about the former Vice President and turn it on the President,” she pushed back.Many including Sarah Huckabee Sanders, former Press Secretary under President Trump, took to Twitter during and after the briefing to praise the new Press Secretary on her debut.“Proud of my friend Kayleigh for doing a great job in her first briefing,” Sanders wrote. “It’s one of the toughest but most rewarding parts of the job and she handled it with confidence and grace. Well done @PressSec!”Proud of my friend Kayleigh for doing a great job in her first briefing. It’s one of the toughest but most rewarding parts of the job and she handled it with confidence and grace. Well done @PressSec!— Sarah Huckabee Sanders (@SarahHuckabee) May 1, 2020McEnany “crushed it,” Jason Miller, Communications Director for the 2016 Trump campaign, said.He outlined all the ‘rules’ for Trump’s communications strategy – all of which she hit: “1) Tell the truth. 2) Don’t speculate. 3) Give [Trump] flexibility & don’t box him in. 4) Drive [Trump’s] positives even if question [sic] doesn’t allow for it. 5) Turn stupid questions back on the questioner. 6) Be likeable, stay cool!”",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/kayleigh-mcenany-is-a-class-act/
33,Politics,Is Biden Hiding Details of His Private Meetings With China’s Dictator? (VIDEO),"This morning MSNBC exclusive with Joe Biden revealed something just as interesting as the would-be Democratic Party nominee’s response to his alleged extra-curricular sexual activities. Biden declared this morning:…the fact is that there’s a lot of things, of speeches I’ve made, positions I’ve taken, interviews that I did overseas with people, all of those things relating to my job, and the idea that they would all be made public in the fact while I was running for public office, they could be really taken out of context. They’re papers or position papers, they are documents that existed and that — when I met, for example, when I met with Putin or when I met with whomever, and all of that could be fodder in a campaign at this time.Excuse me?That’s a candidate for President of the United States asserting he doesn’t want his records as a representative of the public (a Senator) released into the public record, because they “could be taken out of context”.Maybe, he’s nervous about the fact that over the years, Biden has kowtowed to a number of America’s foreign adversaries. Or maybe there’s some Tara Reade stuff buried in the University of Delaware archives after all.All credit to MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski. She didn’t let him off the hook.And Biden’s protests reminded us at the War Room: Pandemic show of a clip we found back during the impeachment saga.Remember Biden’s bragging about getting the Ukrainian prosecutor fired?Well at that same Council on Foreign Relations event, Biden boasted of “25 hours” of private meetings he had with President Xi Jinping – the dictator in charge of China and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).In addition to Biden voluntarily bringing up meetings with Vladimir Putin (wild, and potentially a red herring) – who knows what else the records contain of Biden’s activities as a Senator for Delaware?Have a listen for yourself:Watch the full clip from War Room: Pandemic, below:",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/whats-biden-hiding-when-he-says-he-wants-records-to-stay-sealed/
34,Politics,Trump Says He’s Seen Evidence That Coronavirus Came From Chinese Lab,"“We’re looking at exactly where it came from, who it came from, how it happened,” said President Trump in a response to a question about the origins of the coronavirus Thursday afternoon.Asked if he had seen “anything” that gave him a “high degree of confidence” that the Wuhan Institute of Virology – the P4 lab near the Chinese wet market where the coronavirus outbreak may have began – was the origin of the virus, Trump responded:“Yes, I have. Yes, I have. And I think that the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves. Because they’re like the public relations agency for China. And this country pays them almost $500m a year.”President Trump went on: “They shouldn’t be making excuses when people are making horrible mistakes. Especially mistakes that are causing hundreds of thousands of people around the world to die.”WATCH:Asked in a follow up question what gave him such confidence, he said: “I can’t tell you that. I’m not allowed to tell you that.”The speculation over the origins of the coronavirus have been the subject of intense scrutiny as of late, but were first questioned by former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon on Episode 1 of his War Room: Pandemic podcast back in January.While establishment media outlets have poured scorn on the matter, U.S. intelligence agencies have remained skeptical over the official explanation for the virus.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Thursday morning: “The entire Intelligence Community has been consistently providing critical support to U.S. policymakers and those responding to the COVID-19 virus, which originated in China,” the ODNI said in a statement. “The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.”",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/trump-evidence-coronavirus-chinese-lab/
35,Politics,The Freedom to Take Responsibility: Liability and Reopening America With Common Sense,"America has endured challenges which were unknown before the start of this pandemic. States are on the verge of making very tough decisions about reopening America and letting people get back to work. No recovery will be perfect, and we can’t stay locked down forever. Business must re-open, albeit wisely. Children must eventually go back to school, albeit cautiously. Societies must come back together, albeit prudently. You can almost see the sharks circling. As the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board presciently wrote: “Millions of Americans will lose their jobs and tens of thousands will die from Covid-19. Leave it to the plaintiff bar to make money off the misery.” But now is certainly not the time for this.We are in a time in which healthcare providers are making difficult decisions in real-time. “They shouldn’t be sued unless they are grossly negligent,” according to the Journal. The same is true for businesses. This is a time for America to get back on its feet, not for ambulance-chasers to be waiting in the wings for large-scale settlements. It’s time for personal responsibility.Senate Majority Leader McConnell has called for liability protection as businesses begin to re-open their doors. He even went so far as to say that “[w]e can’t pass another bill unless we have liability protections. That’s the only way we’re going to ultimately begin to get past this.”Perhaps this pandemic has presented the perfect time for tort reform?Bradley Blakeman laid out a compelling argument for it, writing: “[i]t’s unfair for governments and businesses to bear the burden of liability for policies made in good faith to remediate or prevent further harms much greater to their populations and customers than if such policies are not made and instituted at all.”  Therefore, he added: “Coronavirus tort reform litigation legislation is needed — now.”In his book The Death of Common Sense—How Law is Suffocating America, Philip K. Howard addresses how law and lawsuits have permeated every area of society to un unhealthy degree. He writes: “[a]voiding legal risk becomes our goal. We pause, we worry, we equivocate, and then we divert our energy into trying to protect ourselves.  Responsibility is preempted by law.” And in the present case, responsibility may be preempted by the threat of frivolous lawsuits by plaintiff’s firms who are likely ramping up advertising as this is being written.It’s time for common sense.  Insurance companies will have to step up and clarify the extent of their coverage. Businesses will have to use wisdom and caution. Patrons and everyday citizens will have to do the same. It’s time for everyone to take individual responsibility in order for us to collectively recover. As states begin to re-open, Americans will adjust to our brave new world.But as Howard wrote: “America needs a new operating system. Instead of dragging every choice through legal mud, we need to pull law back into a framework that safeguards an open field of freedom… the freedom to take responsibility.” ",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/reopening-america-liability-coronavirus/
36,Politics,Explaining The Case of General Flynn: A Set-Up From The Start,"Lt. General Michael T. Flynn was set up by “rogue elements” of the FBI. Unsealed documents now in the public record proves it for anyone looking at this case with a sober mind.The end goal for those involved in this “case” was never to find the truth of an allegation, as any legitimate investigation would do. Instead, the end goal of this “investigation” was to persecute a man for standing on the wrong side of bureaucratic power.The most damning of the documents comes in the form of handwritten notes (pictured below).It isn’t made clear by the document who is writing the notes, so I will refer to him merely as “the author”.It’s worth noting that Maria Bartiromo reported notes sounding exactly like these would be released in the coming days. In her report, she said the notes were taken by James Baker who was then the General Counsel for the FBI.The notes describe a change of heart by whomever is writing them on just how to proceed with the Flynn interview that was going to be conducted in the White House. The critical part of the notes start by saying:“Yesterday, I agreed that we shouldn’t show Flynn [redacted] if he didn’t admit. I thought about this last night, and I believe we should rethink this. What’s our goal? Truth/admission, or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired? We regularly show suspects evidence with the goal of getting them to admit their wrongdoing.”The author is describing the difference between investigating General Flynn with good faith, and persecuting him for being on the wrong side of the political aisle.At the time, Flynn was under investigation for a violation of the Logan Act. This allegation was based around a phone call that Flynn had with the Russian ambassador: Sergei Kislyak. On the call, there was a brief discussion about sanctions where no commitments were made either way. This supposedly constituted a violation of the Logan Act. The allegation was specious and worthy of mockery.Nonetheless, Flynn was being investigated for a violation of the Logan Act.If these rogue elements of the FBI were actually pursuing a Logan Act case, then they would show Flynn the evidence of him talking about sanctions on the call with Kislyak. That would force him to admit his “wrongdoing”, as the notes’ author says. But his position wasn’t the popular one.The notes go on to say:“I don’t see how getting someone to admit their wrongdoing is going easy on them. If we get him to admit to breaking the Logan Act, then hand it to the DOJ and let them decide what to do with it.”The notes seem to counter the argument that was given to the author by those who didn’t want to show Flynn the transcript of his call with Kislyak. From these notes, we can reasonably assume that these people didn’t want to show Flynn the transcript because it would constitute “going easy on him”.But how would that be?It’s easy enough to determine. The DOJ would laugh this Logan Act case out of their building as soon as it landed on a prosecutor’s desk. There was no way that any federal prosecutor would take a 3-Star general, and incoming National Security Advisor, to court for doing his job. That would be a smoldering and disgraceful end to the career of whichever prosecutor was dumb enough to touch that case. These FBI agents seemed to know that. And they didn’t want to “go easy” on Flynn.The notes go on:“Or, if he initially lies, then we present him [redacted] and he admits it, document for DOJ, and let them decide how to address it.”.The author of these notes is now describing a more hard-nosed way of dealing with the Flynn interview that would still have a tenuous connection to legitimate law enforcement.In this scenario, it is left to the DOJ to decide whether or not Flynn intentionally lied—or whether he simply misremembered the events of his call with Kislyak. Evidently, this also constituted “going easy” on Flynn. But how come?Because the DOJ would laugh this one out of the building even more quickly than the first scenario. Not only did they bring a ridiculous Logan Act case that nobody would prosecute, now they were bringing a case over someone not remembering the specific events of a phone call. That sort of case—lying to a federal agent—is almost never worth bringing to court, unless it’s an absolute slam dunk.Disgraced former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was a recent beneficiary of this.The method, despite its hard-nosed tactics, still represented “going easy” on Flynn.For starters, there was no way it resulted in a prosecution. There was also no way it resulted in much of a public scandal for Flynn, because this case is just so laughably absurd. But it was deeper than that. In reality, this option was unacceptable for the same reason the first option was unacceptable.In either case, it would require the FBI being honest about the predicate for the interview.They couldn’t cryptically claim that Flynn was in deep contacts with Kremlin officials, possibly as part of some nefarious collusion scheme that didn’t exist. If this was about collusion between Trump and the Russians, then Flynn’s lie about his conversation with Russians about sanctions had the appearance of meaning. It felt much worse than merely misremembering the details of a phone call, after the FBI questioned the National Security Adviser for doing his job. They had no case if they were honest about the interview’s predicate, and so they lied about it. For what it’s worth, the author really didn’t agree with the games that were apparently being played.The notes go onto say:“If we’re seen as playing games, the WH (White House) will be furious. Protect the institution by not playing games.”That part is self-explanatory. This was the author screaming at the moon, desperately hoping the people around him wouldn’t bring a flamethrower to the reputation of the FBI. Ambushing Flynn in an interview, and making him perfectly recall the events of one phone call out of a thousand was—in the author’s view—playing games.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/the-case-of-general-flynn-a-set-up-from-the-start/
37,Politics,"FACT CHECK: No, The White House is NOT Selling a $125 Commemorative Coronavirus Coin","Liberal websites and verified Twitter accounts – including an MSNBC producer – have claimed the Trump White House is selling a commemorative coronavirus coin. The only problem is, it’s not true.A website called WhiteHouseGiftShop.com started selling commemorative coins in April.But the site has nothing to do with the White House, nor the U.S. government, nor President Trump, contrary to what far-left websites like LGBTNation would have you believe:The head of the far-left ‘Media Matters’ website implored his followers to stop spreading the fake news on Wednesday afternoon.Matthew Gertz tweeted:People, https://t.co/NhJA1wwGFj is not affiliated with the actual White House, please stop tweeting the coin thing. https://t.co/8Jt5rFhvBf— Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) April 29, 2020Few, however, heeded his call.In addition to general bleating from anti-Trump social media accounts, Twitter’s verified users on the left began sharing the baseless claim:The list of fake news merchants extended to NBC/MSNBC producer Nick Ramsey, who usually blogs about drag queens for the NBC website.He wasn’t the only “blue checkmark” to do it:The shop itself has a curious backstory.While seemingly once affiliated with the White House under President Harry Truman, the website now appears to be run privately by an individual named Anthony Giannini.Talking Points Memo reported in 2018:It seems pretty clear to me that The White House Gift Shop has no actual connection to the White House or the U.S. government. It seems like it either did or does have some sort of informal connection the Secret Service. But that’s not clear. Indeed, it’s not even clear it has a current legal status as a corporation.And there’s a little more to the story:There was once an actual ‘White House Gift Shop’ in the basement of the Old Executive Office Building. But the current ‘The White House Gift Shop’ is a private for profit company which has no connection to the White House or the Secret Service or any other government entity, despite that fact that it seems to go to some lengths to give the impression that it does.Here’s the story. The White House Gift Shop is wholly owned by Giannini Strategic Enterprises, LLC located in an office on 301 Front St in Lititz, PA and incorporated in Pennsylvania. That’s where the store is located too. GSE is owned by Anthony Giannini, who is also the CEO and Executive Director of ‘The White House Gift Shop.’As I explained earlier, the history of the Gift Shop goes back to a service organization affiliated with the US Secret Service. As recently as a decade ago it was run by the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division Benefit Fund. But on December 27th, 2011 the UDBF signed a contract with Giannini Strategic Enterprises to take over the Gift Shop business and run it on the UDBF’s behalf. In essence, the UDBF licensed GSE to run their store on its behalf.Never mind all the facts, eh?As long as the left gets a few fake news jabs off at this White House, the fact checkers at Twitter and other social media companies will turn a blind eye and let the world consume confect, anti-Trump stories all day long.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/fact-white-house-not-selling-coronavirus-coin/
38,Politics,"Bill Opened the Gates to Chinese Dominance, Now He Calls It ‘A Distraction’","Bill Gates made headlines commending China’s response to the novel coronavirus outbreak. Gates told CNN, “You know, China did a lot of things right at the beginning, like any country where a virus shows up.” We now know that once Chinese government officials learned of the possible pandemic in China, they hid the information from the Chinese people for six days and allowed the city of Wuhan to host a mass banquet as millions began traveling for Lunar New Year celebrations. President Xi Jinping did not warn the Chinese people of the outbreak until the seventh day, January 20th, when more than 3,000 people had already been infected. Later in the CNN interview, Gates called blaming China’s handling of the virus a “distraction” and said, “I think there’s a lot of incorrect and unfair things said, but it’s not even time for that discussion.” Except it is time. Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1975. The internet age and dot-com boom grew Microsoft into a multinational tech company in the blink of an eye. With Gates at the helm, Microsoft’s global presence focused East as the company moved a great deal of their manufacturing overseas to China. As a result, Microsoft employees in US cities like Oregon, Seattle, and San Francisco saw their jobs shipped overseas to sweat shops in China. Microsoft’s investments in Chinese tech growth at the direction of Gates grew corporate’s bottom line but devastated American tech workers unable to rival China’s cheap labor, low production costs, and state subsidizes. Over years of Microsoft’s business dealings with China, Gates developed relationships with Chinese Communist Party leaders and CCP affiliated business executives and like Alibaba’s Jack Ma, and, in 2014, touted their shared philanthropic commitments. Gates’s charitable interest in China began in 2007, when the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation opened a Chinese office dedicated to reducing poverty and improving health. The Gates Foundation mission statement for their China office reads: “We have been focused on unlocking potential in a way that benefits China and the rest of the world.”He even wrote on his personal blog in 2014:Microsoft came to China very early and was one of the first multinational companies to set up a dedicated research group here. As a result, we were able to recruit amazing talent; while I’m certainly biased, I think MSR-Asia holds a nearly unique place in China and continues to attract fantastic computer scientists.When it comes to technology, China seeks unchallenged control, often to the detriment of the rest of the world. In 2018, Yinou Li – China Director of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – participated as a panelist at the Fourth Annual China and Globalization Forum in Beijing to discuss “China’s Race for Tech Supremacy.” China’s desire to dominate world technology, with the aid of tech corporatists like Bill Gates, targets developing nations most aggressively. Take Africa, for example. Despite criticism of China’s debt-trap diplomacy across the continent, Gates lauds China’s aid to Africa as an example of “creating a shared future.” Bill Gates’s reluctance to condemn the CCP’s exploitative endeavors across the developing world mirrors his unwillingness to criticize China’s botched response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Unlike Gates, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is willing to speak to the destruction the Chinese Communist Party unleashed on their own people and the world through their failure to alert global health experts of the outbreak. In one interview Pompeo said: “China caused an enormous amount of pain, loss of life, and now a huge challenge for the global economy and the American economy as well by not sharing the information they had… you should know we still don’t have full transparency from the Chinese Communist Party.” Highlighting China’s mishandling of the novel coronavirus pandemic is not a distraction. Perhaps Bill Gates that is too distracted by his Chinese awards and thank you notes from President Xi to hold the dishonest Chinese Communist regime accountable.

39,Politics,"Michigan Gov Ended Elective Procedures, But Not Abortion","In Michigan, Governor Gretchen Whitmer instituted some of the harshest and strongest measures of any state in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus. From prohibiting public gatherings of any size, banning visits to friends and relatives, to requiring stores to close off entire sections (which confusingly included garden centers and plant nurseries) Michigan has instituted extreme measures to curb any further spread of the virus.Although many have slammed Whitmer’s approach as a gross overreach, condemning her executive orders as “draconian,” her hypocrisy is what warrants real criticism and intense scrutiny.Early on, Whitmer banned all non-essential businesses from operating.“I would encourage any business that is not sure if they’re life-sustaining, to probably assume that they are not,” she said, also encouraging people to take the crisis seriously and stressing that the closure all non-essential places of operation would save lives.Yet Governor Whitmer has not only allowed abortion clinics to remain open, she has also defended them, calling the procedures a “life-sustaining” part of healthcare.“A woman’s health care… her ability to decide if and when she starts a family is not an election, it is a fundamental to her life. It is life-sustaining, and it’s something that government should not be getting in the middle of.”The future is bright…. and pink!@mippadvocates pic.twitter.com/hUcnNdQk6q— Governor Gretchen Whitmer (@GovWhitmer) July 15, 2018This is ironic considering abortions always claim an innocent life.Also, as far as the government’s involvement goes, Governor Whitmer has been at the forefront of government overreach and nonsensical policies that Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey says, “unnecessarily hurt regions of our state and sectors of our economy that can operate, safely.”States like Texas, Louisiana, Ohio, Mississippi, Arkansas, and more, have issued orders halting non-essential medical procedures and elective surgeries, including abortions, to conserve limited medical supplies and equipment, focusing solely on fighting the coronavirus.But in Michigan, despite ending all elective surgeries, abortion is deemed a “necessity” and is somehow considered a “life-saving” procedure.Whitmer has shown she is willing to restrict travel, shut down businesses, and ban public gatherings and elective surgeries, but she is unwilling to restrict abortion.“Far from an essential service, abortion is not a treatment curing pregnancy. Prioritizing ending life in the name of a life-ending virus is heartless in the extreme.” writes Kristan Hawkins.The hypocrisy by Governor Whitmer and liberals across the country reveals the left’s agenda to exploit a crisis in any way possible.Whitmer’s actions with abortion bring up concerning questions and undermine her own statements about doing everything possible to end the pandemic.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/michigans-gov-wont-stop-abortion/
40,Politics,How Trumpism Succeeded While The Establishment – Left AND Right – Failed in the Pandemic Response,"Let’s begin with an understanding: the Wuhan-virus was the rare public crisis without a sufficient body of peer reviewed research to form the sorts of crystalline policy white papers issued at places like the Hoover Institution. Like Trumpism itself, it was an unforeseen phenomenon where common sense, life experience, and the ability to construct theories of human motivation would identify the truly insightful.The latter point was especially key in the initial stage of the outbreak.Vanity Fair has noted that President Trump’s earliest and most ardent supporters were the first to express public alarm over the coronavirus.In January, Jack Posobiec – a reporter for One American News Network – reported that China was taking extraordinary measures to contain a virus that was causing death in the Wuhan province. He called for a China travel ban on January 22.  The same day,  Sen. Tom Cotton sent a letter to Alex Azar, Secretary of HHS, urging immediate action “to prevent the virus from becoming a pandemic.”On January 24, Posobiec and OANN would broadcast the leaked cell phone footage from inside China showing the crackdown. Posobiec also appeared that day on the newly launched War Room: Pandemic podcast with my editor at The National Pulse, Raheem Kassam, to sound the alarm, calling the events in China “the biggest story in the world.”Tucker Carlson also hit the Wuhan-virus early and often from his mega-platform on Fox.The mainstream media ignored the elephant in the room until Trump himself issued the travel ban on January 31.  Then the media interrupted impeachment coverage only to allow the president’s opponents to call him xenophobic.Rather than occupy the political high ground always ceded to the first to sound an alarm, however, a vocal, powerful, entrenched establishment on the political right refused to admit that the virus was a big deal. Pandemic was converted into anti-left polemic as soon as enough facts could be cherry picked to say, “Relax, this whole thing is a plot against you.”The talking point that emerged was the virus was either just the flu, or no different than the Swine Flu outbreak during the Obama administration – and any attempt to cast it as something more was a sinister flanking maneuver against President Trump’s successes.Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.The purveyors of this dreck pander to their audiences by telling them what they want to hear, skipping blissfully into conspicuous traps on this and other issues.Obviously, the Left was going to use the virus against Trump.  But the way to parry that was not to downplay the outbreak.  Politically, that position – though it gained clicks in February – was going to bite the entire Trump movement in the ass by March.And it did.  The best gotchas the Democrats will have in their anti-Trump ads before the election will be some of the casual things notable Republicans said about the virus in February.Trump’s response will be that he banned travel from China in January, which none of those establishment voices had asked him to do. Trumpism will owe its survival in November to those who issued the first warnings.Score one for the asymmetrical thinkers on the Right who are not beholden to ideology or their place in the “promote my book, please!” hierarchy that some have appropriately called “Conservative, Inc.”There is only one way to fight a pandemic, and it is not unlike fighting a war. Experts must intervene and develop coordinated strategy to save lives.That is a problem for Trumpism, which at its heart is a movement against Washington know-it-alls who have ruined everything they touched for half a century.Displaying typical inertia, Washington’s massive existing federal bureaucracies downplayed the outbreak and did not offer coordinated plans to battle it. President Trump was left to create his own, ad-hoc group of advisors on January 29, whom he would call a Task Force.The strategy chosen involved extreme social distancing and a de facto shut down of the economy. The purpose was to slow the spread of the virus so that the health care system could treat the sick.There was really no alternative. Had Trump ignored his experts and formulated a different plan – keeping everything open, for instance – and if Americans were left gagging for air in hospital hallways, it would have been a national disgrace. Trump’s working-class supporters have quietly borne the brunt of the shutdown. Unlike members of Congress, they have to show up for work to get paid. President Trump is compelled, by his obligations to them, to loosen coronavirus restrictions as soon as he can, and he seems to know that.As all choices in life, this decision cannot be left completely to the doctors. Drs. Birx and Fauci are being asked to solve a medical problem, and they are giving a “lose 50 pounds and don’t eat fatty foods” recommendation of the type Americans commonly ignore without dying. At some point the President will have to save America by disagreeing with his doctors. One of the incidental benefits of shutdown has been the accumulation of data, meaning the next series of moves will be better informed than what came previously. There is reason to hope that the virus is seasonal and a vaccine may be ready in time for its reemergence in the fall.New York hospitals reached surge capacity but did not go over it. That is a massive policy win. President Trump is now moving to reopen the economy with reasonable restrictions.If any state governors disagree, that’s on them. President Trump appropriately led the nation into these austere measures, and he was required – as soon as possible – to begin the process of leading us out.

41,Politics,"Top Hagerty Staffer Worked For NeverTrumpers AND Democrats, Worked for Controversial EB-5 Immigration Firm","Bill Hagerty – an establishment Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Tennessee – has hired a campaign advisor and fundraising coordinator who has brazenly worked for ‘NeverTrumpers’ and Democrats, all while profiting from the sale of American citizenship at a top EB-5 visa firm.Kim Kaegi proves Hagerty hasn’t abandoned his establishment past, nor embraced the ‘America First’ doctrine.Despite the red flags, Hagerty recently gave Kaegi a top spot on his campaign in yet another incident which reveals his sudden pro-Trump about-face is mere politicking, especially given his long-standing affiliation with Mitt Romney and support for Jeb Bush in the 2016 Republican primary.Even after Bush’s campaign flopped, his second choice was amnesty champion Senator Marco Rubio.Kaegi’s political rolodex is quintessential establishment Republican: she’s been a lead fundraiser for Governor Bill Haslam, gubernatorial candidate Randy Boyd, Senator Bob Corker and Senator Lamar Alexander.Haslam – a Never Trumper – declared he wouldn’t vote for then-candidate Trump in 2016, noting “the best thing for the party would have been for him to step aside.”Boyd is a Romney devotee: at a 2016 conference, Boyd refused to support Trump, adding Romney “is somebody I would aspire to be like” and fundraising for President Trump was “anathema” to him.And Senators Corker and Alexander are the epitome of establishment Republicans.Sen. Corker thinks President Trump “would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation” and could place America “on the path to World War III” while Sen. Alexander believes in amnesty and called President Trump’s 2017 travel ban “inconsistent with our American character.”And despite establishment Republicans insisting they’re “principled conservatives,” Kaegi fundraises for the other side of the aisle.In 2016, she contracted to fundraise for Nashville mayoral candidate Charles Bone, a staunch Democrat who raised over $500,000 for Obama’s 2012 campaign. After his candidacy flamed out, she pivoted to Democrat candidate Megan Barry who was a delegate for Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention and refused to greet President Trump at the airport.Kaegi’s work in the private sector also demonstrates how she’s not committed to the Trump agenda.According to her LinkedIn, she’s a partner at LCR Capital Partners, a Harvard business school-generated “private investment and specialty finance firm… that sources its capital from global high net-worth investors seeking permanent U.S. residency through the EB-5 Investment Visa program.”Tucker Carlson dedicated an entire segment to the “corrupt” program, asserting it’s often “it’s nothing more than a money-laundering scheme.“A few people get rich by selling a path to citizenship for Chinese nationals and their children. In fact, the program is so rotten that last year Democrats and Republicans actually came together to reform it, to make it more restrictive. Consider that, Democrats making it harder for foreigners to get citizenship.”While the firm may spin their work as “help[ing] global families Access the United States to achieve the American dream,” Kaegi’s complicit in selling American citizenship and profiting immensely from it.At best, Kaegi is a political consultant who puts profit before politics, and at worst, she’s actively undermining the pro-Trump wing of the Republican party.Either way: you can’t drain the swamp if you helped build it.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/hagerty-advisor/
42,Politics,Who Is Tara Reade? Ex Biden Aide Comes Forward With Sexual Assault Allegations.,"Former Senate aide Alexandra Tara Reade accused 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden of sexual assault last month. So who is Tara Reade?The alleged assault dates back to 1993, when Reade was in her mid twenties and working as a staff assistant for then-Senator Biden. She told the New York Times the former Vice President “pinned her to a wall in a Senate building, reached under her clothing and penetrated her with his fingers.”Reade formally filed a criminal complaint with Washington, D.C. police on April 10th of this year.This is not the first time Tara Reade has spoken out against Biden.In April 2019, Reade told The Union newspaper in Nevada that Biden “used to put his hand on [her] shoulder and run his finger up [her] neck.”This, while she was working for him.“I would just kind of freeze and wait for him to stop doing that,” she recalled.Reade says she filed a sexual harassment complaint in one of the Senate personnel offices. Biden’s campaign denies this ever happened, but reporter Rich McHugh explains: “[University of Delaware] – which houses the collection of Joe Biden’s senatorial papers – just confirmed to me that the papers ‘will remain closed to the public until two years after Mr. Biden retires from public life.’”He also spoke with an intern who worked under Reade in Biden’s Senate office, “who said that as of mid-April 1993, Reade was abruptly no longer managing the interns. And this intern found that ‘odd.’ The timing coincides with when Reade says she complained.”And @UDelaware — which houses the collection of Joe Biden's senatorial papers — just confirmed to me that the papers ""will remain closed to the public until two years after Mr. Biden retires from public life.""— Rich McHugh (@RichMcHugh) April 21, 2020The former Senate aide first recounted the alleged incident in its entirety on The Katie Halper Show in March: “I wanted to be a Senator; I didn’t want to sleep with one.”Reade explained the events leading up to the incident: her superior requested she deliver an “athletic bag” to then-Senator Biden, stating: “he wants you to bring it… he’ll meet you.”Reade says when she first saw Biden, he was conversing with someone who left as she approached.“He just said, ‘hey, come here, Tara.’ And then I handed him the [bag]. He greeted me, he remembered my name. And then we were alone – and it was the strangest thing. There was no exchange, really. He just had me up against the wall.”“It happened all at once,” Reade recalled. “The gym bag – I don’t know where it went. I handed it to him and it was gone; and his hands were on me and underneath my clothes.”In a detailed account of the events that transpired, Reade told Halper that Biden’s hands went “down [her] skirt, and then up inside it.” She said Biden “penetrated me with his fingers… He was kissing me at the same time, and he was saying something to me.”“He said several things. I can’t remember everything he said, but I remember a couple of things. I remember him saying first, as he was doing it, ‘do you want to go somewhere else?’”Reade confessed what had really stuck with her is what happened after the alleged assault.“He had me against the wall, after I had pulled away, and he said ‘hey, come on. Heard you liked me.’ And I knew he was angry. Right after, he took his finger—he just pointed at me and said ‘you’re nothing to me.’ He just looked at me, and he goes, ‘you’re nothing.’ And I must’ve reacted… because that’s when he took me by the shoulders and said, ‘you’re okay. You’re fine. You’re okay.’ But then afterwards it kept replaying in my head.”“Last April, when all that stuff came out,” she said, referring to her first allegation against the former Vice President, “I got really, really sad about it. And the thing that I remember most – almost more than the assault itself – was just being told that I was nothing. And he was right. That’s how people treated me; that’s how his office treated me. And I have no platform. I have no one. And to him I’m nothing.”“If people want to know why women don’t come forward, that’s a good example of why,” she told Halper.If Tara Reade had accused @realDonaldTrump and not @JoeBiden she’d be on the front page of every magazine, and have a book at  #1 in the New York Times bestseller list by now.— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) April 28, 2020Though there were no witnesses to the assault itself, Reade’s account has been corroborated by four individuals who all remember her telling them about the alleged assault shortly after it occurred: her brother, Collin Moulton; her former coworker, Loraine Sanchez; an anonymous friend; and her neighbor at the time, Lynda LaCasse.“This happened,” LaCasse asserted to Business Insider about the alleged assault. “I know it did because I remember talking about it.”According to Business Insider, “LaCasse said she decided to speak up now, at a time when Reade’s story is under intense scrutiny in the media and facing denials from the Biden campaign, because she believed Reade’s account when she first heard it.”LaCasse explained: “I have to support her just because that’s what happened. We need to stand up and tell the truth.”Sanchez, who worked with Reade for a California Senator in the mid 1990’s, also told Business Insider she remembers Reade “complaining” about being sexually harassed by her boss during her time in D.C., then “fired after raising concerns.”Tara Reade’s brother, Collin Moultin, also talked to Business Insider. In his statement, he recalls his sister  saying Biden “had his hand under her clothes at some point.”Though the fourth individual favored anonymity, she spoke with Katie Halper about her interactions with Reade after the incident, confirming Reade’s story.In addition to the four corroborations, a 1993 video from Larry King’s show on CNN featured an anonymous caller from San Luis Obispo, California discussing issues her daughter faced when working for a “prominent Senator.”Joe Biden sexual assault victim Tara Reade’s mother apparently called into CNN about the matter in 1993… pic.twitter.com/ufkw0K4Uog— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) April 24, 2020“I’m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington [D.C.]” the woman said. “My daughter has just left there after working for a prominent Senator and could not get through with her problems at all.”“The only thing she could do was go to the press,” she emphasized, “and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.”Reade confirmed on Twitter that it is in fact the voice of her now-deceased mother, Jeanette Altimus, on the recording.“This is my mom,” she wrote. “I miss her so much and her brave support of me.”This is my mom. I miss her so much and her brave support of me. https://t.co/okU80kqWAI— taratweets ( Alexandra Tara Reade) (@ReadeAlexandra) April 24, 2020Despite the caller’s anonymity and no mention of Reade or Biden, CNN reported that in addition to confirmation from Reade herself, “some of the details of the call (it was from San Luis Obispo, California, where her mother lived at the time) seem to suggest it was indeed Reade’s mother.”Tara Reade is certainly not alone in her accusations against Joe Biden. Seven other women have come forward in the past year alone to accuse the former Vice President of inappropriate touching and kissing, sparked by Lucy Flores’s accusation published in the Cut last April.Flores, a Democrat politician from Nevada, detailed the encounter in her essay:“I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, ‘I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?’ He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening.”Though the Democrats and mainstream media are willing to excuse the cognitive and political issues their candidate presents, the ever-growing pile of accusations and evidence against Biden very well may prove to be an insurmountable hurdle in his campaign for the presidency.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/who-is-tara-reade/
43,Politics,Justice for General Flynn.,"Justice may finally be coming for Lt. General Michael Flynn.A complete and total exoneration, and a serious look at the depth of his prosecutor’s misconduct. This is according to new legal filings by Flynn’s relentless pitbull, patriot attorney, Sidney Powell.Lt. General Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in November of 2017. As part of his guilty plea, it was agreed upon that Flynn would cooperate fully with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The motive was clear from the start.The prosecution’s goal for General Flynn to flip on President Donald J. Trump, forcing some kind of “confession” vis-a-vis Russian collusion that didn’t exist. Perhaps Flynn could also flip on Trump for the obstruction of justice charge that then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe unilaterally opened.It isn’t unusual, nor illegal, for the FBI to coerce testimony out of a suspect in order to pursue a larger suspect. Of course, it’s usually reserved for making mobsters flip on their bosses.It was a particularly perverted use of the tactic to try to make an advisor flip on his President.It was never ethical, and that much was obvious. But now? We know it was never legal.Whenever the prosecution flips a defendant into a cooperating witness, they must be transparent with the court and other defendants on just how they enticed that person to cooperate. This is done to ensure due process in the courtroom.If a mobster is flipping on his boss in exchange for charges being dropped, the jury has to know that. It colors the motivations of the mobster, and should be part of the deliberations. This practice was solidified into law by the Giglio v. United States Supreme Court case.Flynn’s attorney, Sidney Powell, is alleging there was a secret deal between the prosecutor Brandon Van Grack and Flynn’s previous defense lawyers who worked at the Covington law firm. The contents of the deal were sickening in their lack of ethics, and made illegal by Grack’s lack of transparency with the court.After baselessly threatening to prosecute Michael Flynn’s son with a crime, Grack quietly told the Covington attorneys the Special Counsel’s Office (SCO) would decline to prosecute Flynn’s son, if Flynn himself pleaded guilty.He made sure never overtly commit to this, but the Covington attorneys understood exactly what was happening.In Exhibit 1 (below) of Powell’s supplement to dismiss, she reveals a largely redacted email correspondence between two attorneys at the Covington law firm. The unredacted portions of the email are damning for those who attempted to prosecute Lt. General Flynn.There is Robert Kelner of Covington, informing his colleague Stephen Anthony that they “have a lawyers’ unofficial understanding that they are unlikely to charge Junior in light of the cooperation agreement.”“Junior” is a reference to Michael G. Flynn, the son of Lt. General Michael T. Flynn.In case there was any doubt of just whom was being referenced by the Covington attorneys in Exhibit 1, Sidney Powell included Exhibit 2 (below). Exhibit 2 is another largely redacted correspondence between the two attorneys, which removes much of the doubt.Sidney Powell has been on a legal quest to get Lt. General Flynn’s case dismissed for egregious government misconduct. And what’s shown there—a blatant withholding of Giglio material from the court—is definitely an example of egregious government misconduct.Perhaps the most enticing line of the legal filing was when Sidney Powell revealed that the government advised her there was “more to come” in the realm of exculpatory evidence for Lt. General Flynn.This evidence is likely coming from the US Attorney in St. Louis: Jeffery Jensen, who was tapped by Attorney General William Barr to perform a review of the Flynn case. Evidently it was both necessary and fruitful, as it already produced a Giglio violation and a promise of more to come.We received a clue of what might be to come when Maria Bartiromo hosted Doug Colins for a segment on her Fox News show.During the segment, Maria said there are notes taken by James Baker about the meeting between FBI agents and Flynn conducted at the White House. The meeting in which Flynn allegedly lied to the FBI.According to Maria, these notes by the FBI’s former chief legal counsel say that the meeting was a “complete setup”, and that “Flynn never lied”.We should learn more about the destruction of Michael Flynn by the government he served honorably very soon.Maria Bartiromo had sources telling her that Michael T. Flynn would be exonerated within the week. For the sake of justice, we can only hope that her sources are completely right.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/justice-for-general-flynn/
44,Politics,Are We Living in the Fourth Turning?,"The Chinese coronavirus has demanded the full attention and resources of America and the world at large, resulting in a time of great instability and crisis. This time of great crisis looks an awful lot like William Strauss (1947-2007) and Neil Howe’s seasonal crisis period foretold in their book The Fourth Turning. For those not familiar with their work, the book demonstrates with compelling evidence that history, and particularly Anglo-American history, has occurred in cycles—or seasons.The writers predict, based upon the traceable “rhythms of modern history,” that “sometime before the year 2025, America will pass through a great gate in history, commensurate with the American Revolution, Civil War, and twin emergencies of the Great Depression and World War II.”The book, published in 1997, claims that “[h]istory is seasonal, and winter is coming.”This time of wintery crisis the authors label a Fourth Turning is not necessarily one event, but rather a period of time.An argument could be made that the current season of crisis began with September 11th, 2001, or even the 2008 economic crash.  These two events caused exponential instability in America and around the world, just as we are experiencing today.The effects of the virus have been unprecedented and have not been limited to the fields of health and medicine. The Chinese coronavirus has upended national and global matters such as travel, economics, supply chains, and geopolitics. The virus has required massive shutdowns and unprecedented economic relief. This has led many to compare our present reality with perilous times of seasons past.U.N. Secretary António Guterres warned that “[t]he current coronavirus outbreak is the biggest challenge for the world since World War Two,” as reported by BBC News.World War II just so happened to be America’s last Fourth Turning, according to Strauss and Howe. The point is bigger than merely marking the epoch in which this virus is occurring.Perhaps, as Strauss and Howe demonstrate, past and current seasons of history offer clues to where we, as a nation and a world, may be headed.According to the authors, a Fourth Turning leads to a time of renewal, or a “high,” just as winter leads to spring. The time which follows a crisis occurs “when a new civic order implants and the old values regime decays.”So while our country and others contend with the risks, questions, and fallout related to the virus, it is wise to acknowledge the potential for societal and global restructuring to be happening in the background.There is the potential for such shifts to come in both big and small ways.For instance, there is a growing trend against the use of traditional banknotes. This would enhance the possibility of future digital currencies—saying nothing about what will be left of the economies in which a potential digital currency would be used.Additionally, world powers are not sitting idle while most of the world is being told to stay at home.An Executive Summary released by the U.S. Department of State indicated concern that, “China may be conducting small nuclear tests in secret.”Additionally, Iran just launched a military satellite and the leadership situation within the North Korean dictatorship is, at present, uncertain. These and countless other reports highlight the reality for potential geopolitical disaster.The authors of The Fourth Turning point out that “[h]istory’s howling storms can bring out the worst and best in a society.”We may indeed be living in what Strauss and Howe refer to as a Fourth Turning. Whether or not this is true, one thing is for sure: we need 2020 vision.As the authors quote in preface to The Fourth Turning: “That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.” (Ecclesiastes 3:15)",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/are-we-living-in-the-fourth-turning/
45,Politics,"Ex-Biden, Clinton, AND WHO Staffer Says Coronavirus is Likely From Chinese Lab","Jamie Metzl, a former staffer to both Senator Joe Biden and former President Bill Clinton has asserted that the novel coronavirus came not from a wet market, but from a Chinese lab.He has also served as a World Health Organization administrator.Metzl recently declared in an interview on CNN that “it seems pretty likely” that the virus was released from the lab through an unfortunate security breach, which the CCP have suffered routinely.He is also quick to point out the virus could’ve been studied for “very good reasons”, and remains careful not to point any fingers at the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Metzl is no political friend of the Trump administration, and suggests the failures of the CCP were “massively exasperated by the failures of the Trump administration.”Nevertheless, his intervention will raise eyebrows from establishment colleagues who have been keen to tamp down ideas like his as “conspiracy theories“.In a Newsweek article, Metzl contends:It my view that Chinese researchers at these institutes were studying these viruses with the best intentions of developing surveillance systems, treatments, and vaccines for the good of humanity. Countries make mistakes, even terrible and deadly ones. I was in the White House when the US bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. We believed it was an accident but many Chinese people thought it was a deliberate act. I understood why. Moments like these are inherently difficult and we should all do our very best to find the answers to our most important questions in the most honest, careful, and considered manner possible.In this spirit, I have compiled this summary of the preliminary evidence, drawn from Project Evidence and, to a lesser degree, the other sources. Because China is still restricting access to the relevant data and people, the case remains speculative by necessity. Those restrictions themselves should concern us all.Metzl then lays out in long-form detail a timeline of events that explain his thesis (below).And for the deniers like Bill Gates, who have urged the world to wait before finding out more about the origins of the virus, Metzl says: “Just as we wouldn’t imagine having a plane crash and not immediately trying to figure out what happened, we can’t let the COVID-19 crisis unfold without urgently understanding how our systems have so spectacularly failed.”Below is a timeline from Metzl of why he believes the coronavirus came from a Wuhan lab, not a wet market.

46,Politics,GIRDUSKY: How The Immigration Executive Order Was Neutered,"On Monday night, President Trump tweeted about an upcoming immigration Executive Order:In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2020What unfolded afterward was a chaotic mess, and the final executive order (EO) was watered-down and managed to anger his base.Multiple sources told me there were two fragments of the administration working on this EO, both without each other’s knowledge. Early in the week, President Trump became aware of polling that reflected a growing shift in public sentiment to halt all immigration and asked Ken Cuccinelli to begin drafting up the order.Breitbart News released a portion of the original executive order, which included many more restrictions on legal immigration.Things were moving along until the tweet on Monday night.While the missive was celebrated by several Senators, including Hawley and Cotton, sources said the President’s son-in-law Jared Kushner began getting calls from several people in Silicon Valley and by Tuesday morning Kushner was pushing President Trump to water down the EO. Amber Athey reported a similar story in Spectator USA.At a meeting held at 12:30 pm on Tuesday with Trump’s Domestic Policy Council that included Cuccinelli, Kushner, and others, Kushner demanded the EO be moved into the White House and not include any guest worker visas.According to multiple sources involved in the meeting, Kushner attacked the first draft of the EO, as well as Cuccinelli himself, allegedly even slandering Cuccinelli.Compounding the problem was Stephen Miller’s choice to pick Sylvia May Davis as his top deputy to work on the EO. I’ve tweeted since Feb. 2019 that Davis is Never-Trump and that she has pushed around ideas like increasing legal immigration for years.Davis did little to nothing to keep as much of the original executive order in place as possible. Miller held an off-the-record meeting with several pro-Trump media personalities, none of them immigration hardliners, on how he planned to evolve the executive order before his staff leaked the meeting to The Washington Post.Miller did what he always does: took credit for everyone else’s work and made promises he has no intention of carrying out.In the end, Trump’s halt on immigration will affect fewer than 10 percent of immigrants, Breitbart News reported.Chad Wolf appeared on Fox News and said that this is only the first step and that the administration is looking at expanding the ban to different immigrant groups, but don’t kid yourself if you believe Wolf has any intention in shutting down anything.Wolf is a liberal and former H-1b lobbyist. He comes out of the Nielsen/Kelly wing of DHS and expanded the number of H-2B visas before the virus hit the US, only to retract them several weeks later.If you want more insider information like this, sign up free to Ryan Girdusky’s Nationalist-Populist newsletter.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/trump-immigration-executive-order/
47,Politics,Bernie Betrayed the Populist Left.,"Michael Bloomberg spent $1.2 billion on his four-month presidential campaign. Bloomberg suspended operations on March 4th, after which he promptly endorsed Joe Biden.Some claimed this was his intention all along. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich characterized the endorsement as follows: “The fact that Bloomberg has thrown his support to Biden should remove any lingering doubts about where the big money is going and what the Democratic establishment wants. And what it doesn’t want – a wealth tax, Medicare for All, and a Green New Deal.”The fact that Bloomberg has thrown his support to Biden should remove any lingering doubts about where the big money is going and what the Democratic establishment wants. And what it doesn't want — a wealth tax, Medicare for All, and a Green New Deal.— Robert Reich (@RBReich) March 4, 2020Was Bloomberg’s campaign simply an effort to prevent Senator Bernie Sanders getting the nomination? Evidence for this lies in his media offensive against Sanders prior to Super Tuesday.Sanders was the frontrunner at that time due to a “resounding victory” in the Nevada caucuses. Yet, following Bloomberg’s digital advertisement blitz, Sanders lost 10 of 14 states on Super Tuesday to Biden.Cui Bono?Clearly, Joe Biden stood to benefit the most from Bloomberg’s unprecedented spending. Who was most disenfranchised? Arguably, Sanders supporters.There’s a deep irony to it, especially if we glance back to another populist-left event that lasted only several months yet had a lasting effect on the conversation inside the Democratic Party: Occupy Wall Street.In September 2011, protesters began camping out in Zuccotti Park, a block away from Wall Street in Manhattan. Thousands took part in a series of marches in New York, eventually spreading around the world.Four years later, Bernie Sanders’s candidacy gave the network a new way to address perceived economic grievances.The Senator’s success in the 2015 election, despite being underfunded, was largely attributed to the groundwork that had been laid with Occupy.Remarkably, the man who dispersed the encampment in Zuccotti Park was none other than Michael Bloomberg. The Washington Post presented a scathing description of what transpired at the time:“The behavior of the NYPD and the mayor’s office, in ordering this brazen action while blocking the press and the public from reporting on the eviction, is a disgraceful display of unnecessary force on a protest that for the most part has behaved lawfully and respectfully throughout its two-month existence.”To recapitulate, the man who silenced the Occupy movement in 2011 is the same man who ambushed Sanders’s 2020 campaign.It didn’t stop there.Biden has been described as the “establishment” candidate. It should come as no surprise that he would receive Bloomberg’s endorsement.But Sanders endorsing Biden, too? For many this did not compute.How could a self- described socialist justify backing the same man as did Bloomberg: a living, breathing archetype of the “one percent”?Perhaps only Biden possesses the ability to merge these two opposing viewpoints into a cohesive unit. The only other logical conclusion, however, is that Sanders supporters were deceived.It wouldn’t be the first time.The collective attention span has not forgotten his behavior during the 2016 primaries. Sanders described former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the “establishment candidate”.Yet when he ultimately endorsed her, it was fed to his supporters as a “unity moment” for the party. This came in spite of a federal judge acknowledging that the DNC did indeed rig the primaries against Sanders.There have been plenty of signs that Sanders was nothing more than an ‘establishment’ wolf in sheep’s clothing. His family financially benefitting from his political career over the course of decades, for example.Or his minimizing of Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. Or, perhaps, failing to address Biden’s questionable behavior in the Ukraine.These were red flags. But Sanders endorsing the same man as Bloomberg? Perhaps that is confirmation that they are one and the same: establishment.If so, the most marginalized group of voters of the last decade are those aligned with the Occupy movement.They were silenced by Bloomberg in 2011. They were silenced by the DNC establishment in 2016. And in 2020, it dovetailed: they were silenced by both Bloomberg and the DNC establishment.Sanders’s actions have spoken much louder than his words in the last two election cycles. The significance of his endorsement of Biden is the same as his endorsement of Clinton: a betrayal of his support base.The opportunity to “occupy” the Democratic Party ended with Sanders’s endorsement of Biden.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/bernie-betrayed-the-populist-left/
48,Politics,"EXCLUSIVE: CCP-Linked Firm Targets U.S. Schoolkids With Chinese ‘Morality and Values’, Shows CCP Military Parades in Schools","Chinese learning platform Lingo Bus, known to censor anti-Chinese Communist Party content, has “donated” services to U.S. schools in an attempt to exploit the shift to online learning as a result of the coronavirus.A broader Chinese language initiative in Utah has led to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) military parades being shown to children in public schools, with teacher Zheng Yamin declaring: “Behind the language is the culture. When we learn Chinese, we are also learning Chinese culture, Chinese morality and values…“…On National Day of China last year, the children watched a grand military parade with me,” she added. “They thought President Xi Jinping was cool. Later, when they saw President Xi Jinping delivering the New Year’s speech, they thought President Xi Jinping was very kind.”A subsidiary of China-based company VIPkid, Lingo Bus “provides one-on-one personalized Chinese lessons for children aged between 5 and 12″ with real-time, virtual lessons.Alongside its mission to promote Chinese, the firm is attempting to dictate school curricula. In classic CCP-fashion, the company has fired teachers that used maps depicting Taiwan as independent of China and those who dare to address the Tiananmen Square Massacre.Lingo Bus is now influencing the curricula in U.S. schools, where the CCP’s propaganda and censorship schemes in light of their culpability for the novel coronavirus pandemic are in over-drive.Former Utah State Senator Howard Stephenson described the donation:Lingo Bus, a Chinese education company specialized in e-learning, has made a very generous donation of their Chinese language-learning platform and resources to Utah students, to aid them while they are being educated online at home. It came in mid-March, when it became clear that Utah schools were closing and would remain closed for at least several weeks.Chinese-state media spun the story as: “In Utah, Passion to Study Chinese Undimmed Amid Coronavirus Crisis.”But there’s a darker side still to the “language initiative.”Stephenson, a pro-amnesty Republican who spearheaded the introduction of Chinese language learning programs to 15,000 students at 76 Utah schools, “aligned himself with the Confucius Institute and teachers from Han Ban, the Chinese institution aimed at promoting Chinese language worldwide.”The Confucius Institute serves as the international propaganda arm of the CCP.The group deploys Chinese teachers to push the regime’s narratives, and chapters have established presences on roughly 90 American college campuses.Stephenson, however, welcomes China’s takeover: “We have to recognize the emergence of China as the economic power and world’s largest population-wise nation, and we as Americans must realize that China is our future, and we should be China’s future.”“I have complete confidence in Han Ban teachers and am impressed with how committed they are to teaching Utah’s math and science curriculum with full fidelity,” he emphasized.Stephenson even honored the organization’s deputy director-general at the Utah State Capitol in 2018.This collaboration has made American schoolchildren puppets in the CCP’s global propaganda campaign.At Cascade Elementary, a K-6 school which has half of its students participating in Lingo Bus, fourth-grade students were made to write letters to China’s President Xi Jinping at the request of a Confucius Institute-employed teacher.Xi responded February 15th – as coronavirus raged in China – imploring the students to “become young ‘ambassadors’ for Sino-US friendship.”The teacher behind the display, Zheng Yamin, admitted that the Confucius Institute’s purported mission to spread the Chinese language is really a trojan horse for spreading China’s “morality and values”:Behind the language is the culture. When we learn Chinese, we are also learning Chinese culture, Chinese morality and values.She also described how class time is dedicated to watching CCP military displays:On National Day of China last year, the children watched a grand military parade with me. They thought President Xi Jinping was cool.

Wade as ‘Erroneous Precedent’, Paves Way for Legalized Abortion Challenge","Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh cited two major abortion-related decisions in a recent opinion explaining when “erroneous precedents” should be overturned. The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling stated that jury verdicts require unanimity  to convict a defendant of a serious criminal offense, overturning the conviction of Evangelisto Ramos, who a Louisiana jury found guilty of second-degree murder by a 10-2 vote.As part of the ruling, Justice Neil Gorsuch, author of the majority opinion of the Court, argued that stare decisis – the legal principle of determining cases according to precedent – is not supposed to be the “art of methodically ignoring what everyone knows to be true.”He wrote that “although the precedents of the Court warrant deep respect, stare decisis has never been treated as “an inexorable command.”Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in his concurring opinion, wrote that the Supreme Court has a long history of overturning previous rulings “the doctrine of stare decisis does not mean, of course, that the Court should never overrule erroneous precedents. All Justices now on this Court agree that it is sometimes appropriate for the Court to overrule erroneous decisions.”Kavanaugh mentioned two landmark abortion cases in his opinion, Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case which legalized abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 ruling that upheld the essential holdings of Roe but overturned other parts of the ruling.Justice Kavanaugh pointed out: “…in Casey, the Court reaffirmed what it described as the ‘central holding’ of Roe v. Wade, the Court expressly rejected Roe’s trimester framework, and the Court expressly overruled two other important abortion precedents.”Whether or not Kavanaugh’s comments mean anything beyond the case at hand is unknown. Regardless, it has touched off a firestorm of speculation that the groundwork is being set for an eventual overturning of Roe v. Wade.Kavanaugh, whose Senate confirmation process revolved largely around his view of precedent – as liberals feared that his confirmation would provide the votes necessary for an eventual overruling of Roe v. Wade – is viewed as a conservative-leaning justice, though his opinion on overturning landmark abortion rulings remains to be seen.Although this ruling provides us with little insight as to the future of legalized abortion in America, the fact that the conservative-leaning justices have signaled their willingness to overturn established but erroneous precedent is causing both liberals and conservatives to wonder about the future of the fallacious precedent set by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/kavanaugh-roe-v-wade-abortion/
50,Politics,Legislator: Declare Virus Cover-Up ‘Act of Terrorism’ to Free Up $1TRN in Business Insurance Relief,"Former Suffolk County prosecutor and New York Assemblyman Anthony Palumbo is urging authorities to consider declaring the coronavirus cover-up by the Chinese Communist Party an “act of terrorism”.The move, in addition to heaping up pressure on China, would free up funds at a time when Americans are suffering from the economic impact of the CCP virus. Palumbo wants Secretary Munchin to use the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) to release funds for companies that insure businesses affected by the virus. The insurers could then provide funds through a clause in their contracts for terrorist acts.Palumbo: By suing #China under terrorism clause, almost $1T immediately becomes available to our citizens through insurance carriers, reimbursed through federal government's Terrorism Risk Insurance Fund#WarRoomPandemic👉https://t.co/HuZDFNTwiv pic.twitter.com/m1nKTSwx7o— War Room: Pandemic ☣️ (@WarRoomPandemic) April 23, 2020China and the World Health Organization (WHO) are already under fire for their handling of the pandemic.

51,Politics,Hunter Biden’s Chinese Fund Helped Outsource U.S. Manufacturing Jobs,"Hunter Biden’s Chinese investment fund negotiated the outsourcing of American manufacturing jobs in “one of the largest acquisitions by a Chinese company of a U.S.-based automotive manufacturing company in history.”Like father, like son: the 2015 buyout was a continuation of then-VP Biden’s oversight on outsourcing millions of manufacturing jobs, chiefly to China. And while working class America reeled, the Bidens profited.The $600 million deal was barely scrutinized even though it gave a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) entity access to American automotive technology with “potential military applications.”The deal was authorized by the Committee on Foreign Investment while Joe Biden was Vice President and Christopher Heinz, stepson of Obama-era Secretary of State John Kerry, was also a partner at BHR.The younger Biden remained on the board as recently as October 2019. In a recent letter, lawyers said: “Mr. Robert Hunter Biden no longer serves as an unpaid director on the board of Bohai Harvest RST (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co., Ltd. effective from October 2019.” But they didn’t clarify anything about Hunter Biden’s 10 percent ownership stake.A statement by the U.S. firm being sold – Henniges Automotive – called the deal “one of the largest acquisitions by a Chinese company of a U.S.-based automotive manufacturing company in history.”While the company retains five domestic facilities in North Carolina, Missouri, Oklahoma, Iowa, and its global headquarters in Michigan, post acquisition, Henniges has added factories across the world, instead of in America.In 2016, the company Chinese purchaser – AVIC Automotive Systems Holding Co. Ltd – added a factory in Poland, and a new European Headquarters in the Czech Republic.The company also expanded in Latin America, investing $30 million to construct its first production plant in Brazil, expected to generate 300 jobs.And in Mexico, the company added two plants in Durango: “Gomez Palacio II” cost $60 million dollars and generated more than 800 jobs and “Gomez Palacio III” is in the process of being built and is expected to create 600 new jobs.In China, 2 facilities were added including a 70-person factory in Suzhou and a technical center in Shanghai. And another factory in Beijing, parent-firm AVIC’s operating city, was added to the Henniges’ portfolio roughly a week before the acquisition became public.While Henniges had begun outsourcing before Hunter Biden got involved, AVIC accelerated the practice, operating on a considerably larger scale. In the decade prior to AVIC guzzling up Henniges, the company only added two new factories. It took less than three years following the 2015 deal for AVIC to surpass this number.The newly Chinese-owned company expanded its presence to Canada, Germany, Czech Republic, and Mexico. In China, it acquired its pre-existing Chinese facilities through its partner China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology and the joint company Beijing Wanyuan-Henniges Sealing Systems. In 2014, Henniges gained complete ownership of the company despite sacrificing its autonomy to AVIC roughly one year later.This AVIC-fueled shift also contributed to transitioning the automotive supply chain increasingly global, which leaves American consumers at the “whims, values, and crises of other nations across the globe who do not have our best interests” at heart.While the CEO of Henniges said CCP-affiliated companies may be “coming here to learn, but not to take it back to China and forget about North America,” he also acknowledged “they want to create global companies.”The deal evidently lacked any protections for American factories or workers given AVIC’s outsourcing onslaught. And that’s the Bidens’ modus operandi: sell out American workers and cash out in the process.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/hunter-biden-outsource/
52,Politics,"BIZARRE: Harvard Prof Blasts ‘Authoritarian’ Homeschooling, Claims Government ‘Should Deny the Right’ of Parents","One of Harvard University’s faculty directors has lashed out at homeschooling, asserting the practice is “dangerous” and gives parents “authoritarian” control.In other words, Harvard comes out against parenting. Oh, and Christians, too. Naturally.Elizabeth Bartholet, a law professor and faculty director of the schools Child Advocacy Program at Harvard went so far as to claim the increasingly popular practice of homeschooling should be banned.Prof. Bartholet claims that it gives parents “authoritarian” control over their own children, noting that 90 percent of homeschoolers are driven by conservative, Christian beliefs and that the parents are “extreme religious ideologues” who question science and will seek to remove them from mainstream culture.In an 80-page document published by the Arizona Law Review, Bartholet spuriously addresses “the rapidly growing homeschooling phenomenon and the threat it poses to children and society”.Apparently, the Harvard professor believes free thinking individuals that worship God and disagree with establishment education focused on climate change, gender transitioning, open borders, and participation trophies are a danger to society.She writes: “States should impose significant restrictions on homeschooling,” adding: “[t]he new regime should deny the right to homeschool, subject to carefully delineated exceptions for situations in which homeschooling is needed and appropriate. Parents should have a significant burden of justification for a requested exception. There is no other way to ensure that children receive an education or protection against maltreatment at all comparable to that provided to public school children.”The belief that the government can raise a child better than the parents is arguably the more acute danger, and one that shouldn’t be overlooked.Michael Donnelly, senior council for the Home School Legal Defense Association called her views “extreme” and explained that calling “American homeschooling parents too ignorant or too religious goes against the weight of decades of scholarly research on homeschooling which demonstrates positive academic, civic, and social outcomes”.Statistics prove students who are homeschooled graduate college at a higher rate than their peers – 66.7 percent compared to 57.5 percent – and earn higher grade point averages.Not too bad for a bunch of conservative Christians with a set of deep religious beliefs and core family values. Or did she mean “basket of deplorables”?This scrutiny couldn’t have come at a worse time for the university.The institution is currently under the microscope of both the country and the President for attempting to secure $9 million from the Cares Act while receiving inordinate amounts in endowments: in excess of $40 million dollars.When asked about the handout at a recent press briefing,  President Trump responded: “They shouldn’t have taken it”.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/bizarre-harvard-prof-blasts-home-schooling-as-authoritarian/
53,Politics,Illegal Immigrants Released as Open Borders Lawyers Ramp Up Efforts,"The lockdown may be preventing the British public from enjoying it’s wonderful coastline, but it hasn’t stopped a wave of illegals from washing up on it. Nor has it stopped the work of all the lawyers who are working through the crisis to get illegal immigrants released.Since the start of the lockdown, more than 550 illegal immigrants have made the trip across the English Channel. Their hope is that the journey is very short, because their goal is to be caught by UK Border Force and safely ferried across.  It’s the same ploy traffickers have used so successfully off the coast of Africa. A rubber dinghy filled to overflow is launched into the sea with the express purpose of being rescued.A very profitable business, highly attuned to market forces: people traffickers have been charging £13,000 ($16,000) a seat of late, up from the £7,000 ($8,600) they were charging pre-pandemic.Since the 20th March 33 of our clients have been granted bail, and just 1 refused. Judges continue to agree that our clients should be released. If the Home Office is determined to continue detaining people we will keep working to get everybody out, one by one.— BID (@BIDdetention) April 15, 2020But they’re not the only ones profiting from the Wuhan virus.  A host of legal charities and legal aid firms are now demanding their piece of the immigrant pie. BID, (Bail for Immigration Detainees) Detention Action, Matrix Chambers as well as Britain’s largest legal aid firm – Duncan Lewis Solicitors – have all joined in litigation seeking the release of illegal immigrants.And far from recognizing the difficulties Britain is currently enduring, the lawyers are actually using the worldwide lockdown to further their legal argument. Simply put, they say “you can’t deport, therefore you can’t detain.”Toufique Hossain of Duncan Lewis Solicitors said “…it is now abundantly clear the Secretary of State has no lawful basis to detain simply because removals can no longer take place.”Bella Sankey, Director of Detention Action questioned whether illegal immigrants need be detained at all, seeing as “the majority of people detained in our immigration estate will eventually be released back into the community.” She then went further by stating that not releasing them would be, “A danger to public health.”In response the UK Government has so far released more than 350 people from immigration detention. They have also halted new detentions for people liable for removal to 49 countries including Jamaica, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Sudan.It is symptomatic of a wider malaise that even during this pandemic, for illegal immigrants and legal aid lawyers, it is business as usual.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/lawyers-are-using-the-ccp-virus-to-get-illegal-immigrants-released/
54,Politics,"Tennessee Senate Hopeful Hagerty Hired His Friend’s Kids, Including A Shariah Law Expert","Bill Hagerty – an establishment RINO masquerading as a Trump-style populist to win a Senate seat in Tennessee – appears to have used the Department of Economic & Community Development (ECD) to garner political favor at taxpayer expense.Hagerty’s resume epitomizes the swamp: he served as a member of President George H.W. Bush’s staff on the President’s Council on Competitiveness, was the Finance Co-Chair for Romney for President and worked on his Presidential Readiness Team, and Jeb Bush was his first choice candidate for President in 2016.Even after Bush’s 2016 candidacy flamed out, Hagerty’s next choice was pro-amnesty Marco Rubio. He only came to support President Trump once he secured the nomination.As commissioner of the taxpayer-funded Tennessee ECD, his hiring and firing decisions seem based on advancing his own interests, the modus operandi of the Bush and Romney ilk Hagerty’s aligned with for decades.Hagerty hired and promoted two of Sen. Lamar Alexander’s children, alongside a Shariah finance specialist and ex-Obama intern. His actions are especially galling considering the ECD is meant to empower small businesses operating in Tennessee.Shortly after Hagerty’s appointment as commissioner, he promoted Sen. Alexander’s son Will to ECD’s Chief of Staff.Will’s concurrent position as treasurer for a Tennessee refugee resettlement organization certainly suggest Hagerty’s interesting qualifications for promotion. Hagerty also hired another one of Sen. Alexander’s children, Leslee Alexander, as International Trade Director just prior to leaving the office after his three year tenure.And his favors even transcend Sen. Alexander’s immediate family: Alice Rolli, a former Lamar staffer turned campaign manager in 2014 while still on the ECD payroll, took over Will’s position when he departed.Hagerty took the D.C. beltway’s nepotistic revolving door to Tennessee at a cost to taxpayers.And another Hagerty-era hire was equally suspect.The decision to bring on Samar Ali as Assistant Commissioner for International Affairs received considerable backlash from Tennessee Republicans.And Hagerty’s remarks from a “First Tuesday” gathering alluded to his real motives for the hire: “When it was known we were looking to fill a position in our office, I got a call from her father asking me if I would look at her resume. Like any father, he would like for his daughter to move closer to home. I interviewed her for the job, and she was the best qualified.”“Best qualified” is an interesting way to describe Ali, a former White House Fellow under Obama – which Hagerty made possible – and specialization in counseling clients on “Sharia compliant transactions.” Ali’s father, for whom the favor was done, is on the board at the D.C.-based Jerusalem Fund think tank, an anti-Israel organization which under his auspices have hosted speakers who’ve denied Israel’s right to exist and promoted the Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions (BDS) campaign.DC is already chock-full of people who exploit their power to advance their own interests and their friends’.

56,Politics,California Gov. Newsom Buys $1BN Worth of Masks from CCP-Linked Company,"California Governor Gavin Newsom recently committed his state to a $990 million contract with BYD (Build Your Dreams), a Chinese Communist Party-linked electric car company, in exchange for 200 million protective masks. The governor’s advisors have disclosed few details about the agreement, but, according to reports, the state of California has already wired BYD the first $495 million installment. Newsom’s aggressive move received bipartisan backlash from his within his own state legislature and party. Two days after the announcement of the deal, Assemblyman Phil Tin (D-San Francisco), Chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee, said: “We would never approve a budget this way. The whole reason we don’t do a budget one request at a time is we want to know the big picture.” The big picture raises more questions than answers. Founded in 1995 and headquartered in Shenzhen, China, BYD manufactures electric cars, busses, forklifts, solar panels, and rechargeable batteries. BYD’s founder, Wang Chuanfu, is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and has served the party in numerous official capacities – most recently as member of the Fifth Shenzhen Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee. BYD assists China’s “Made in China 2025” plan and has pocketed billions in CCP electric-vehicle government subsidies. In March 2019, BYD signed an agreement with Huawei Technologies to promote comprehensive strategic cooperation.The United States decided to blacklist Huawei, a state-affiliated Chinese telecommunications giant, last year over national security concerns. According to United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, Huawei poses “massive security and privacy risks.” Despite the Huawei-BYD association, Frank Girardot, spokesman for BYD promises: “There’s no spyware in BYD buses. There’s nobody in the Chinese government that [sic] tells us what to do.”Still, members of Congress caution against spending federal dollars on Chinese state-owned or subsidized companies. Representative Harley Rouda (D-CA) said: “It’s in the national interest to make sure we have viable rail and bus industries and to protect us from spying and sabotage of our public transportation system.”BYD presence in California began in 2008, when company associates approached Southern California officials with plans to build electric vehicles. Later, in 2013, then Governor Jerry Brown gave BYD the green light and announced plans to manufacture electric buses for the greater Southern California area.During a tour of BYD’s Shenzhen facility, Brown said, “I think it’s very important that we start replacing the bus fleet with electric buses.” Since 2014, BYD has spent more than $1 million lobbying California state officials and, from 2008 to 2017, received more than $330 million in grants, subsidies, and public contracts.Providing state contracts for Chinese government-owned companies like BYD to set up shop in the United States hurts American industry and exposes our infrastructure to an untrustworthy totalitarian regime. Experts estimate the US electric-bus market will jump from $745 million in 2018 to about $1.95 billion in 2024. State governments should halt their funding of CCP affiliated entities and instead enlist US corporations to meet this growing demand. ",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/newsom-1bn-ccp-masks/

In Missouri, the impact of the virus is very real – thousands have been infected and many have died, families have been separated from dying loved ones, small businesses are shuttering their doors, and those living paycheck to paycheck are struggling to put food on their table,” said Attorney General Schmitt.“The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease. They must be held accountable for their actions.”AP further reports:Schmitt’s office is seeking unspecified damages for deaths in Missouri and the hit the virus has taken on the state’s economy.The number of Missouri deaths statewide rose by 16 Tuesday to 215, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The number of cases rose by 156 to 5,963For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.The full case can be read here, and states:An appalling campaign of deceit, concealment, misfeasance, and inaction by Chinese authorities unleashed this pandemic. During the critical weeks of the initial outbreak, Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistleblowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded personal protective equipment—thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable. Defendants are responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians, and they should be held accountable.It adds:Missouri is not alone: the virus unleashed by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government has left no community in the world untouched.As well as:This COVID-19 pandemic is the direct result of a sinister campaign of malfeasance and deception carried out by Defendants.Read the whole document:Key factual allegations laid out by the Missouri AG are as follows:In the Missouri Attorney General’s lawsuit against the Chinese government, the key factual allegations are that in the critical weeks between December 2019 and January 23, 2020, the Chinese Government engaged in misrepresentations, concealment, and retaliation to conceal the gravity and seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak from the rest of the world.1. Denying the risk of human-to-human transmission. The first known case of human-to-human transmission occurred in early December. By late December, Chinese health officials had plenty of evidence of human-to-human transmission. On December 30, Chinese doctors at Wuhan hospitals posted on social media that they were observing human-to-human transmission. Until January 20, Chinese officials continued to insist that there was no evidence of human transmission—denying solid evidence to the contrary. Additionally, Chinese officials failed to report the potential for human-to-human transmission to the World Health Organization for weeks.2. Silencing of whistleblowers. Between January 1 and 3, 2020, Chinese officials arrested eight doctors and forcibly silenced them as “rumor-mongers”—an action that was broadcast on state media, likely to deter others from speaking out. One doctor at a Wuhan emergency room was disciplined when she told her staff to wear masks when dealing with patients, fearing human-to-human transmission. Additionally, there were reports of journalists covering the outbreak who disappeared.3. Failing to contain the outbreak. While denying human-to-human transmission, Chinese officials took little to no steps to contain the outbreak. By January 13, the Chinese government was aware of spread to Thailand. For the next week, they began treating COVID-19 as a serious and contagious virus without advising the public. During that time, millions of people traveled through Wuhan, and many thousands were infected, making a worldwide outbreak almost inevitable. A potluck event for 40,000 people went forward in Wuhan on January 16. The Chinese government took no serious steps to contain the outbreak until January 23 —when it was far too late.4. Hoarding personal protective equipment. Reports indicate that Chinese officials, while they were concealing the outbreak, began hoarding quality PPE while permitting only defective PPE to be exported to the rest of the world. This hoarding endangered the lives of health care workers and first responders in other countries.The COVID-19 outbreak has caused hardship in Missouri and across the globe—death, isolation from sick and dying loved ones, massive unemployment, economic dislocation, uncertainty, and trillions of dollars of economic losses. China should be held legally responsible.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/missouri-sues-china-over-coronavirus-cover-up/
58,Politics,"POLL: Two Thirds Hold Unfavorable View of China, Post-Coronavirus","The novel coronavirus pandemic has given rise to a new generation of China hawks in America according to a Pew Research study.And it’s about time.In short: 66 percent of Americans hold “unfavorable views of China,” 62 percent view “China’s power and influence [as] a major threat,” and 91 percent now say it’s “better for the America to be the world’s leading power than China.”To be clear: these sentiments are directed towards the Chinese Communist Party, not hard-working Chinese citizens who are the first victim of the regime’s iron fist and irreverence for human rights, but American workers, who’ve seen their jobs and livelihoods shipped overseas, are close behind.Seventy-one percent of Americans have “no confidence in President Xi.”President Trump’s messaging on China precipitated this unprecedented shift in public opinion – only 47 percent of Americans viewed China in a negative light in 2017 – but the coronavirus and CCP’s culpability in the spread added fuel to the fire.Pew explains the causes: “Economic factors, such as job losses to China and the trade deficit, remain key concerns for the American public. But other issues – including Chinese human rights policies and environmental degradation – also worry Americans.”The abuses are so blatant even “younger people, who have historically been more positive than older Americans toward China, now increasingly hold negative views of the country and are more prone to see it as a threat to the U.S. than in previous years.”While these sentiments have swelled across both parties, Republicans tend to toe a more hawkish line on China. Nearly three-quarters of those on the right view China unfavorably, while with almost six-in-ten of left-wingers do.The Trump administration needs to seize on this shift in public opinion, especially in light of Joe Biden’s weak, corrupt track record on dealing with the CCP.But also remember that in the great game of geopolitics, China isn’t worried about being hated. They’re worried about becoming the world’s new superpower, and overtaking the United States – made easier by establishment forces willing to wage impetuous wars in the Middle East lacking long-term strategy while leaving American workers and manufacturers to defend themselves against the CCP’s predatory economic schemes.But it’s clear that President Trump has reversed the era of “managed decline”: Over 90 percent of Americans agree that the world is better off if the United States is its leading power.Divestment from China isn’t just a pipe dream: Americans have the means and motive to do so.Natalie Winters contributed to this report",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/china-hawks/

The news follows The National Pulse report on suspicious activities by newly created Twitter accounts belonging to China’s “Wu Mao” army.Today, the National Pulse publishes an analysis of recent trends on digital media, below.CLICK HERE TO SUPPORT OUR WORK.China already has taken drastic measures against the American media in their own country, banning U.S. journalists and even managing to shift the narrative into a racism debate, often with the help of the same U.S. media they proscribe domestically.Now, Twitter data collected over the last month from nearly a million randomly sampled tweets shows some dramatic patterns.We studied tweets between March 12th and 20th, aimed at @realDonaldTrump and including the word “Virus”.On a basic level, tweets mentioning @RealDonaldTrump and “virus” also frequently included the word “Chinese” & “China”, followed by “Trump”.The “Chinese-Virus” keyword node (the black bar in Figure 1) emerges as the highest ranked, in turn connected with keywords like “Communist”, “Wuhan”, “foreign”, “awful” and “Italian.”President Trump’s name is also linked with words like “hate” and “crime”.Hashtag usage by all the sample user tweets shows words like “coronavirus”, “Covid19”, and “Trump Virus” followed by “Chinese virus” have dominated the platform. This indicates an almost balanced picture between anti-Trumpers and pro-Trump tweeters.This graph below represents the sentiment analysis.Indeed, all the tweets seem to be skewed on the negative side, with over two million negatives in all the sampled tweets.Based upon the characteristics of bots (new accounts with few followers), the dataset indicates an interesting tendency once it is filtered based on this basis.Profiles created after January 2020 show similar sentiment levels, with 80,000 negative comments dominating the Twittersphere where the virus and POTUS are mentioned.Amongst these, individual accounts showed a tendency to weigh in heavily, and quickly.Take for instance the account @rpgdxw – already deleted – which accounted for 221 of these tweets, falling into the categories of “negative”, “fear” and “anger.”This account – created after March 10th – not only targeted President Trump but also Senators Tom Cotton, Lindsey Graham, and the official White House feed.The black bars below (Figure 7) show the activity level against each target.Some of @rpgdxw’s tweets included messages like:“@realDonaldTrump People ang human beings are never united. Fake communities like America are never strong.

60,Politics,"Biden: China Provides Jobs, ‘Fuels World’s Prosperity’","Joe Biden solidified his reputation as a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sycophant and working class sellout with remarks at the US-China Strategic & Economic Dialogue in 2011.“Middle-Class Joe” had a rare opportunity to confront the greatest threat to American workers – the CCP’s exploitative trading practices and job poaching ad infinitum – and he failed. Miserably.Instead, he praised the relationship as a boon to American employment numbers and extolled the merits of a “rising China.”It wasn’t a gaffe. It wasn’t a blunder. It was quintessential Biden.In his opening statement, setting a tone of appeasement for the entire dialogue, he claimed: “Our trade supported over 500,000 jobs here in the United States, and we made tangible progress during President Hu’s visit especially in the areas of innovation, intellectual property, and exports, all of which we’re following up on.”In reality, America has lost nearly 4 million jobs from China’s predatory trading practices in under 20 years, leaving factories and manufacturers reeling from the beltway’s complicity in CCP-spearheaded outsourcing. And the toll of this isn’t purely economic: “deaths of despair” have risen among the American working class, inextricably linked to China siphoning their jobs and livelihoods.Biden also lets the CCP off the hook for currency manipulation, modern-day economic warfare, whereby China artificially devalues its currency to cheapen exports. And that’s on top of China’s lax environmental regulations and nonexistent human rights protections which keep production costs far too low for American companies to compete with.And contrary to Biden’s insistence, the CCP has also failed to make any meaningful strides towards axing intellectual property theft. A study published by the US International Trade Commission the same year Biden praised China’s progress on the issue “estimated that if IP protection in just China were improved to a level comparable to that in the United States, the U.S. economy would obtain an estimated $107 billion in additional annual sales and net U.S. employment could increase by 2.1-million jobs.”And China’s exports – in addition to the novel coronavirus – have even harmed American lives: Chinese toys are made with toxic lead paint; Chinese fish are carcinogenic due to the country’s polluted water; Chinese candy has been contaminated formaldehyde; and Chinese drywall is made with radioactive material.And despite this long list of grievances, Biden pushed back against China only once throughout the entire speech: on the CCP’s dismal human rights record, calling the regime “friends” while doing so.It’s just the latest evidence to give credence to his moniker “Beijing Biden,” beyond his son’s suspect dealings, belief that “China’s rise isn’t our demise,” and pre-ordained alliteration, begging the question, if this is the tone he takes when negotiating with the CCP in public how can Americans be sure he’ll hold China accountable, especially post-coronavirus?And comments like “a rising China is a positive development” don’t instill much hope. An increasingly powerful and predatory China certainly doesn’t benefit the American middle class or Chinese citizens subject to the CCP’s relentless and brutal authoritarianism, emboldened by further economic success.Yet Biden worships the CCP, praising the regime for “lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty and buil[ding] an economy that now helps fuel the world’s prosperity.” In reality, the only people who’ve prospered alongside China’s global ascent to power have been those of the Biden ilk, establishment politicians and businesses whose affinity for the “made in China” label has crippled the American working class.While Biden is notorious for flip-flopping on every issue in the book, the one issue he’s consistent on is coddling China.In his own words: “As a young member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I wrote and I said and I believed then what I believe now, that a rising China is a positive, positive development, not only for China, but for America and the world writ large.”And history will continue to repeat itself. That’s why for the sake of the American middle class, “Biden 2020” must remain a pipe dream and not a reality.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/biden-china-trade/
61,Politics,The European Union’s Days Are Numbered,"Europe is embroiled in a serious health and economic crisis, with coronavirus exposing critical failures at the heart of the European Union.A lack of the oft-touted “solidarity” amongst European countries has led to a rise in skepticism which could mark the beginning of the end for the EU.Having failed to act when vulnerable member nations like Italy and Spain desperately begged for help, supplies, and a collective response to the virus, the European Union is now clamoring for relevance.Not a single EU country responded, instead banning exports of supplies for fear of suffering shortages in their own countries. Some simply closed their borders.“Between the E.U.’s inevitable descent into being the usual moribund bureaucracy and the fact that ancient nations turn inward when threatened, the E.U.’s break-up is beginning to seem inevitable,” writes Andrea Widburg.“The problem lies deep within the E.U. itself. It’s being eaten alive because the individual nations will cling to their national interests and because the E.U. bureaucracy is incapable of reacting quickly to a rapidly changing situation.”This was already demonstrated through the 2008 recession, the 2015 migrant crisis, and the exit of the United Kingdom. Failures which the EU so far manages to survived.Now, with distrust coursing throughout Europe and countries viewing this as the latest in a string of continued failures by the bloc, this pandemic may prove to be its undoing.Italians feel abandoned by their European “friends” and a new poll shows 72 percent of Italians say the EU has not contributed in any way to addressing COVID-19. Seventy-seven percent say that won’t change in the future.This is a massive shift for a nation like Italy.In 2010 the level of trust among Italians in the European Union was 74 percent. It has now fallen to just 25 percent, and a new poll by Tecnè shows that nearly half, 49 percent, of Italians, want to leave the EU.Italy, Tecnè poll:European Union membership referendumRemain: 51% (-20)Leave: 49% (+20)(14% don’t knows excluded)+/- vs. 23-27 November 2018Fieldwork: 9-10 April 2020Sample Size: 1,000#Italexit #coronarvirusitalia— Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) April 11, 2020This turn against the EU is not only evident in Italy, as countries around Europe lash out in frustration against the bloc.In Bulgaria, MEP Angel Dzhambazki echoed this sentiment labeling European Council President Charles Michel a “hypocrite” during a fiery address in the European Parliament this week, he also issued a scathing rebuke over Brussels handling of the pandemic and said that top EU leaders should be “ashamed” of their response to the crisis.In Portugal, Prime Minister António Costa described comments by the finance minister of the Netherlands calling for Spain to be investigated for its lack of budgetary capacity to cope with COVID-19 as “repugnant” and “a threat to the EU’s future.” he went on to stress: “We have to be able to respond together” or else “nobody has understood anything about what the European Union is.”Even in countries with historically favorable views of the EU, like France, tensions are rising and French President Emmanuel Macron is predicting a wave of Euroskepticism in the hardest-hit countries if the EU continues its refusal to support them: “Today, tomorrow, the day after, in Italy, in Spain, perhaps in France and elsewhere.”“It’s obvious because people will say, ‘What is this great journey that [the EU] are offering? These people won’t protect you in a crisis, nor in its aftermath, they have no solidarity with you,'” he said.It is now plain that one of the most critical raisons d’etre of the European Union – the notion of unity in the face of adversity – has been dashed.“Passionate pro-Europeans routinely begin their columns and tweets with the famous quote by Jean Monnet: ‘Europe will be forged in crises and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises’. But many other things can be forged in crises — including Euroscepticism and a belief that, when it comes to the crunch, you really can only rely on your nation.” writes Matthew Goodwin.“We tend to forget this now, but it was the EU’s fumbled response to two earlier crises — the Great Recession and refugee crisis — that convinced Britain’s Leave voters that being in this organization was not in their longer-term economic interests.”This pandemic marks a turning point as countries will continue to see a rise in nationalism and a push for a return to strong independent nations, which cannot happen if they remain members of a failed European project.Unless the EU comes up with a coordinated response to the crisis quickly and is able to bring unity, it will have long-lasting consequences and we may look back on this as the beginning of the end for the European Union.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/european-union-days-numbered/
62,Politics,"FACT CHECK: Yes, Trump CAN Suspend All Immigration to the U.S.","President Trump’s powers on the matter emanate from Section 212 (f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). On Monday night the President tweeted that he would be temporarily suspending immigration into the United States, ushering a cacophony of questions about POTUS’s powers in this area.In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2020They’re pretty clear.According to 8 USC 1182, on Aliens and Nationality, the section entitled: “Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President” or “212(f)” states:Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.The section has been used by presidents past, including Ronald Reagan to tackle corruption, and George H.W. Bush to aid in the thwarting of human traffickers. Even Barack Obama invoked it, in his case to keep out those on the United Nations Security Council Travel Bans list.Furthermore, Section 215(a) states:“Unless otherwise ordered by the President, it shall be unlawful for any alien to depart from or enter or attempt to depart from or enter the United States except under such reasonable rules, regulations, and orders, and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the President may prescribe.”In 2018 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld this presidential authority, stating the Act, “exudes deference to the President in every clause. It entrusts to the President the decisions whether and when to suspend entry, whose entry to suspend, for how long, and on what conditions.”President Trump quite emphatically has the power to stop immigration to the United States, and for however long and almost whatever reason he so chooses.",https://thenationalpulse.com/editor/fact-check-can-trump-suspend-all-immigration-yes/
63,Politics,"Justin Amash – the Anti-Trump, Libertarian Candidate for President – Needs to Sit Down.","Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI) is considering a third party Presidential run, and it’s one of the dumbest things we’ve heard since CNN’s Brian Stelter began to hype now-convicted felon Michael Avenatti for the job.Elected to the House of Representatives in 2010, libertarian Amash made headlines for his opposition to the far-left excesses of the Obama Administration. While he helped found the important House Freedom Caucus, Donald Trump’s election in 2016 appears to have driven Amash off the deep end.“…he wants to have attention,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy explained last year as Amash backed impeachment for what we all now know as the “Russia hoax”.Fooled by the media and co-opted by flawed intelligence agency behavior (read: FISA abuses), for a so-called libertarian, Amash sure did seem to buy the administrative state line.Months later, as Amash finally took the hint and dropped from the Republican Party, President Trump tweeted:“Great news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest & most disloyal men in Congress is “quitting” the Party. No Collusion, No Obstruction! Knew he couldn’t get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat. A total loser!”Nothing President Trump said was untrue.Amash attacked fellow Republicans because President Trump dared to take on the Chinese Communist Party with tariffs.Given the latest public polling on China, the Michigan Congressman might want to keep his mouth shut about the matter if he does indeed run for president.His stance has often looked less ideological and more self-serving.Congressman Amash and his operate a family business called Tekton Tools, which claims its products are made in the USA. Local media reported that tools sold by Tekton are in fact manufactured in China.He was also the only Republican to vote against President Trump’s emergency declaration for border wall funding, despite claiming to support border wall and immigration enforcement.Congressman Amash’s hatred for the president has made him friends in the NeverTrump right as well as the anti-Trump left.These new friends have been urging Amash to run a spoiler campaign for president, probably on the Libertarian Party ticket. They’d be welcome to him.Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson got 3.3 percent of the popular vote in 2020, and Libertarians are hoping for more from Amash. Perhaps this candidate will know where Aleppo is.Such a campaign would likely be counterproductive to the cause of liberty – if Amash cares about it.In his attempt to hurt Trump, the 40-year-old Michigander would only be helping Joe Biden and a Democratic Party working harder than ever to curtail American freedoms.Libertarians like to pretend there are absolutely no differences between the Democratic Party and the GOP.“Replacing one elderly, not-quite-all-there guy with a different elderly, not-quite-all-there-guy — I’m not feeling it,” said Libertarian Party chairman Nicholas Sarwark.Imagine university-style speech codes in common life, Canadian-style healthcare, California-style regulation.Imagine the hyperinflation from a universal income scheme, no more border enforcement, and prosecution for using the wrong pronouns.If that’s the future Justin Amash desires, he should come out and say so. Otherwise, he should sit back down.Vinny Ungro contributed to this article",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/justin-amash-needs-to-sit-down/
64,Politics,Coronavirus Pandemic Shows FCC Got It Right on ‘Net Neutrality’,"Can our healthcare system manage the strain of potentially millions of sick patients? How will our economy cope with stay-at-home orders and millions of jobs lost? And what about our network capacity? Will an unprecedented surge in Internet use — especially with a newfound dependence on streaming video via conferencing services like Zoom — cause widespread congestion that might limit the ability of public health and safety professionals to do their jobs?COVID-19 has in many ways provided a test case to determine whether the FCC’s Restoring Internet Freedom (RIF) order is helpful or harmful to public safety. The controversial order — which made FCC Chairman Ajit Pai a household name — reversed the Obama-era Title II framework (more commonly known as “net neutrality”) and prompted a tsunami of apocalyptic predictions that the Internet would be destroyed forever. Obviously that didn’t happen. And in truth, not only have web users gotten along just fine since the FCC implemented its RIF order, but the end of net neutrality has also made life amid the pandemic much easier.Consider the evidence.Although still early, there have been few, if any, reports of network congestion during this crisis. Instead, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have worked alongside federal agencies pledging commitments to keep Americans connected. Additionally, the ISPs have adopted network management practices that prioritize service to public health professionals and law enforcement personnel while at the same time delivering unimpeded service to the rest of Americans. Millions of workers have been able to telework without issue.Religious Americans have been able to participate in services from their homes. And streaming services like Disney Plus have been able to deliver their product uninterrupted for satisfied customers — as shown by their higher subscription rates. Those who advocated for net neutrality — and against the FCC’s RIF order — warned that ISPs if left to their own devices would throttle speeds and weaken service for consumers. They also suggested that public safety would be put at risk. None of that has happened. In fact, the FCC’s “light touch” approach has allowed ISPs to innovate and compete, creating a better network for both consumers and public safety users. Not only have ISPs in the US embraced a strong commitment to promoting public safety, but they are also doing so in a way that far exceeds the performance of ISPs in other countries under regulatory regimes similar to the “net neutrality” framework.Consider what is happening in Europe, where streaming services like YouTube and Netflix are being forced to reduce video quality in order to help ease stress on their network infrastructure. That’s not happening here in the United States. While Italy’s first responders are depending on the same service that Netflix is, due to Europe’s so-called “net neutrality” rules, first responders in the U.S. are enjoying the “fastest lane” while everyone else in America still gets high-speed access with little to no interruption. That’s what happens when you allow ISPs to innovate and solve problems, rather than force them to spend all their effort trying to adhere to bureaucratic rules that often don’t address the problem at hand.Instead of going back to a heavy-handed approach that treats the Internet like a slow-moving public utility, we should recognize what is happening before our eyes: the FCC’s “light touch” regulatory framework has enabled our ISPs to innovate and flourish so that they can deliver the best product to consumers. And the FCC’s decision to pivot to this approach, which faced enormous political pushback from the Left, looks even better in retrospect. If the FCC had maintained net neutrality, there’s no telling what kinds of network issues would have been faced during this pandemic by our public safety professionals and by millions of working Americans across the country.

66,Politics,Cops Use ‘Gifted’ Chinese Drones by Firm Complying With CCP Data Requests,"Police departments are using “gifted” Chinese drones to enforce social distancing rules. The drones, ostensibly used by law enforcement for a hands-off way to police social distancing, are made by a Chinese firm which sends data back to the Chinese Communist Party.The Daytona Beach Police Departments says the drones possess digital cameras and heat-detecting devices. These systems can detect body temperatures from 99 to 105 degrees.A graphic from the manufacturer – DJI Innovations based in Shenzen, China – reveals 100 drones have been gifted to law enforcement and local authorities in recent weeks. They claim: “…we’re pleased to announce we are distributing 100 drones to 43 police, fire and public safety organizations in 22 states.”Sergeant Tim Ehrenkaufer, who runs the Daytona Police drone unit, said in a statement: “If you have a 103 fever, that’ll come in handy letting us know at a glance: ‘Are you someone who possibly has the virus?’ ‘Do we need to make sure you have extra precautions?’” The Elizabeth Police Department of New Jersey insists: “…we are just trying to save lives, not trying to be big brother.”Intelligence officials, however, fear the drones do much more than just spread automated notices. They spread your data to the Chinese Communist Party, if it so chooses.DJI Innovations – formerly Da Jiang Innovations Science – arguably leads the world’s market drone market, catching the attention of United States intelligence officials back in 2015.We're proud to announce we were selected as recipients of two new Mavic 2 Enterprise response kits as part of @DJIEnterprise 's Disaster Relief Program!

Seriously.The drone – a DJI “Phantom” – slipped past White House security. Following the incident, then-President Barack Obama told agencies to make sure that “these things aren’t dangerous and that they’re not violating people’s privacy.” U.S. intelligence agencies have since grown increasingly concerned over the Chinese drones and the threat their widespread use poses to national security.In early August 2017, the U.S. Army elected to ban the use of all DJI drones citing cyber vulnerabilities. That same month, the office of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeles put out a memo stating officials have “moderate confidence” DJI’s commercial drones and software are “providing US critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government.”DJI denies the accusations, but in 2016 press briefing in China, company spokesman Zhang Fanxi said DJI complies with data sharing requests from the Chinese Communist Party.The New York Times reported:In a briefing for Chinese and foreign journalists at DJI’s headquarters in Shenzhen on Wednesday, Zhang Fanxi, a spokesman for the company, said it was still working out how to deal with the data it collects in China. But for now, he said, DJI is complying with requests from the Chinese government to hand over data.DJI’s user agreement also reads: “We may collect information about you directly from you, from third parties, and automatically through your use of the DJI Products and Services.” The warning continues, “We may share your information with our parent company, affiliates and subsidiaries globally when permitted by law, and necessary to provide you with DJI Products and Services.”DJI occupies two-thirds of the global drone market. The company’s dominance of the drone market undoubtedly assists China’s Made in China 2025 scheme which aims to strengthen the country’s robotics capabilities, particularly in manufacturing and military sectors.The novel coronavirus has exposed the Chinese Communist Party’s unreliability when it comes to information protection and data sharing. The use of Chinese drones by American law enforcement departments dangerously exposes our most critical information systems. READ MORE: China’s Digital ‘Wu Mao’ Army Target Trump Over Coronavirus",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/police-chinese-drones-ccp/
67,Politics,Prince Charles’s ’97 Premonition About Hong Kong Activist Arrests Comes True,"“Thus we left Hong Kong to her fate and the hope that Martin Lee, the leader of the Democrats, would not be arrested…”So wrote the future monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland – alongside all her territories – Prince Charles.His 1997 diary, as Britain handed control of Hong Kong to China, today goes from concern to eerily correct premonition.Martin Lee, alongside up to 14 others including local opposition media owner Jimmy Lai, was arrested by police today in yet another Chinese regime crackdown against democracy protesters.Lee, 81, has been integral to Hong Kong rights and democracy for decades.He co-authored the Hong Kong Basic Law – effectively the constitution of the territory – in the months on the run up to the infamous British handover in 1997.Then, in one of the most heinous examples of an overcorrection from British colonialism, the last jewel of the British Empire was handed to a burgeoning Chinese Communist Party (CCP).In his missives, Prince Charles added:“All the locals were being outwardly, thoroughly optimistic about the immediate future but in the background was the sneaking worry about creeping corruption and the gradual undermining of Hong Kong’s greatest strength – the rule of law.”He was right. The Guardian reports:Police arrested prominent figures, including the media tycoon Jimmy Lai and 81-year-old Martin Lee, the founder of the Democratic party and a senior barrister, in the biggest crackdown on the pro-democracy movement since the sometimes violent anti-government protests that have rocked the former British colony since June last year.The 15 people arrested allegedly organised and took part in unlawful assemblies and police do not rule out that more will be arrested, Supt Lam Wing-Ho said.Also among the detained were the barrister Margaret Ng, lawyer Albert Ho, labour rights activist Lee Cheuk-yan, former legislators Leung Kwok-hung and Au Nok-hin, and younger activists such as Figo Chan, the vice-convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organised several mass protests approved by police last year.The 15 were accused of joining three unapproved protests on 18 August, 1 October and 20 October last year, local media reported.Charles’s words were first published in 2006, when the BBC reported: “The 3,000-word document is said to have been written as the Prince flew back from Hong Kong in 1997 after attending the former colony’s handover to China. He mentioned talks with Tony Blair and the “ridiculous rigmarole” of meeting the then Chinese President Jiang Zemin.”The article suggests Prince Charles “recounted that Britannia [his ship] was followed by a Chinese patrol craft during his stay.”He is said to have written: “The whole business was drearily reminiscent of the Soviets and their behaviour when I was in the Royal Navy over 20 years previously.”The diary was entitled: “The Handover of Hong Kong or The Great Chinese Takeaway.” Extracts can be read, here, including the particularly poignant explainer of the handover ceremony:[Chinese President Jiang Zemin] then gave a kind of “propaganda” speech, which was loudly cheered by the bussed in party faithful at the suitable moment in the text. At the end of this awful Soviet-style display we had to watch the Chinese soldiers goose step on to the stage and haul down the Union Jack and raised the Chinese flag. The ultimate horror was the artificial wind which made the flags flutter enticingly.

68,Politics,"FACT CHECK: Tom Cotton Didn’t Spread a ‘Conspiracy Theory’, But the Media Used CCP Propaganda to Attack Him Anyway","There is new, increasing, and compelling evidence to suggest the novel coronavirus did not originate from the infamous wet market in Wuhan, but rather was the result of “safety and management weaknesses at the WIV (Wuhan Institute of Virology) lab.”While developments don’t yet confirm the theory dismissed early on as “conspiracy,” it suggests details shared most notably by Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) are by no means outlandish.“This virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market.” Sen. Cotton told Fox News’s Maria Bartiromo.And while Twitter accounts like those of the popular ZeroHedge website were banned for suggesting the official Chinese Communist Party line was fraudulent, it behoves us to recall who has been at the cutting on the subject.A February 17 New York Times article by Alexandra Stevenson was titled: “Senator Tom Cotton Repeats Fringe Theory of Coronavirus Origins.”The article alleges, “The conspiracy theory lacks evidence and has been dismissed by scientists. But it has gained an audience with the help of well-connected critics of the Chinese government such as Stephen K. Bannon.” Stevenson claimed, without evidence, that “…right-wing media outlets fan the anger. Beijing, with its heavy-handed censorship and stranglehold on information, unwittingly gives the conspiracy theories a boost.”Stevenson is right about one thing: heavy censorship and hiding information creates an environment that is conducive to the spread conspiracy theories. However, by not even asking basic questions, The NYT once again ends up with its hand in the cookie jar.Yahoo! News put out a video describing Cotton’s theory as debunked. On the clip, one caption reads: “The claim, making its rounds in right-wing publications and on the internet, suggests that the virus may have started as an unleashed biological weapon”. The video then quotes from Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador to the United States, condemning Sen. Cotton’s statements as dangerous, and likely to “fan up racial discrimination and xenophobia.”But Cotton did not insinuate that the virus was man-made. He called for questions to be answered. Something the Chinese Communist Party has so far refused to do, with the assistance of the World Health Organization running public relations interference for them.The Chinese ambassador’s comments were made on CBS’ Face The Nation: one of the countless examples of news outlets propping up Chinese officials to spread their propaganda.The Washington Post originally took a similar angle to Yahoo! News, enlisting an expert to “debunk” Cotton’s claim that the virus may have originated in the WIV.Richard Ebright, the expert that the Washington Post Enlisted, dismissed that the virus was “engineered”, again a claim never made by Cotton, but one which the media appears to want to pin to him.NEW: Richard Ebright, molecular biologist quoted by @washingtonpost to rebut theory that the virus was a bioweapon, tells @AndrewKerrNC COVID-19 may have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology https://t.co/crGU2sfEES— Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) April 3, 2020WaPo conveniently buried where Ebright concurred with Cotton about the possibility of the virus being a result of malfeasance. It wouldn’t be a good look if your chosen expert was also a conspiracy theorist, would it?MSNBC may have the most egg on its face over this situation. A February 17 article made the same assertions as the Washington Post, dishonestly pinning the theory that the virus was man-made on Cotton, and citing Ebright’s claim that this was impossible (while also omitting the part where Ebright agreed with Cotton on the possible origin).The difference with this piece is that the author went wider: attacking the entire Republican Party as conspiracy theorists. “There are some prominent political figures in the nation’s capital who seem a little too fond of conspiracy theories. Folks like Donald Trump and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) routinely seem to embrace some rather nutty explanations for events with more rational explanations. But let’s not forget Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who occasionally embraces some doozies of his own.”MSNBC continues bashing Cotton and other Republicans for dabbling in “conspiracy theories”. The article presents a false premise, then used it to attack an entire party by using other examples such as Cotton worrying about the use of the U.S. southern border for terrorism, or for calling out the Kavanaugh-Christine Blasey Ford hoax.Speaking of “doozies”.More recent reports stating that was long-standing concern about safety and management practices at the lab doesn’t prove anything, but it is compelling evidence that Cotton, Bannon, and other proponents of this theory have been further vindicated, at least in terms of their ideas being labeled as “conspiracy theories.”Sen. Cotton is right that the Chinese government has to be held responsible, at least for their unwillingness to be truthful and transparent with the rest of the world.

And Teen Vogue would rather release those infected individuals into the United States, lamenting deportations “can spread COVID-19 to more countries.”Similarly, readers are encouraged “to film encounters with ICE” which “can help expose abuses, fight deportations in court, and bring attention to a culture of racist and dehumanizing enforcement that continues to separate families and inflict trauma on immigrant communities.”The article provides tips on how to harass law enforcement agents:Collaboration with the group United We Dream, funded by perennial social justice financier George Soros, is encouraged to “demand the Supreme Court delays the DACA ruling.”United We Dream is an extreme immigrant activist group, of the “Abolish ICE” ilk: it developed an app to help illegal immigrants avoid federal authorities.It’s clear Teen Vogue has an affinity for Soros. The outlet also encourages readers to volunteer remotely with the organization Al Otro Lado, whose founder previously worked at Soros’s Open Society foundation and La Raza.Al Otro Lado is deeply involved in the migrant caravan network: it has expressed “support for [the] Central American refugee caravan at [the] Mexico-U.S. border” and has been described as a “mediator” for Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a group known to organize migrant caravans. During the infamous November 2018 caravan, Al Otro Lado also organized at least five same-sex marriages between migrants. The refugee program director commented: “Today the world saw that love cannot be stopped. Not by any wall or borderline.”Teen Vogue also peddles meaningless leftist platitudes like “defund systems of oppression” and instead encourages readers to “fund immigrant rights.” To do so, readers can “help to pay bail for an immigrant community member.”The article also sees no merit to restricting border as a means to combat the spread of the coronavirus, lamenting that restrictive measures only “further marginalize immigrant communities.”A far cry from fashion commentary.Teen Vogue has become just another cog in the left’s wheel, part of their broader social justice sanctioned culture crusade.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/teen-vogue/

71,Politics,"Dr Fauci: Tinder, Grindr Hookups Ok ‘If You’re Willing to Take a Risk’","In a Tuesday interview on Snapchat’s “Good Luck America” Dr. Fauci – the 79-year-old head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases – appeared to endorse the use of dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Grindr in the age of social distancing.Toward the end of the segment, host Peter Hamby asks Dr. Fauci: “If you’re swiping on a dating app like Tinder, or Bumble or Grindr, and you match with someone, and you’re just kind of like, ‘Maybe it’s fine if this one stranger comes over.’ What do you say to that person?”Fauci responded, “You know, everybody has their own tolerance for risks, and it depends on the level of the interaction that you want to have.” He continued, “If you want to go a little bit more intimate, well, then that’s your choice regarding a risk.”Fauci’s response contradicts his earlier espoused believes concerning mitigation and containment efforts. About a month ago, Dr. Fauci joined Mark Zuckerberg for a livestreamed Facebook interview. In the interview, Fauci asked young people, particularly college-age students on spring break trips, to take coronavirus prevention seriously.Fauci said, “Please understand that you will play a major role in ultimately containing this infection by not being careless and avoiding and not listening to the recommendations of physical separation.”Now, in an about-face, Fauci encourages that same age group to partake in random hookups using apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Grindr. The rise of dating apps, particularly among young people, makes casual sex more easily accessible and more anonymous. Some health experts attribute recent surges in sexually transmitted infections to the growing popularity of these sorts of apps. The prevalence of dating apps poses a unique threat to the spread of the novel coronavirus as well. The CDC believes coronavirus is predominantly spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Somewhat logically, intimacy only accelerates the exchange of these droplets and intimacy with anonymous individuals warrants even more alarm. The global pandemic has forced communities across the country to suspend regular activities like going to work, joining in social gatherings, and attending church and school. The resulting blow to the United States economy has been devastating. This past week, another 5.2 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits bringing the total US unemployment to 22 million workers. Dr. Fauci fails to comprehend the devastating realities of social distancing for countless American families and instead encourages Americans to partake in casual sex with random partners as they please.Dr. Fauci’s dating app advice is not only dangerous; it could be deadly. He should be held accountable. ",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/dr-fauci-tinder-grindr-hookups-risk/
72,Politics,WHO’s Tedros Sold Out His Own Country to the Chinese Communist Party,"World Health Organization (WHO) chief Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus helped facilitate China’s neocolonialist expansion into Africa, hailing it as a “win-win.”Describing the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) attempt to garner political and economic influence in every corner of the world, Tedros commented: “As far as we are concerned, it is a win-win situation. [China] comes for business and we negotiate. We make sure that the trade and investment is based on our priorities.”Tedros’s resurfaced comments come from an Al Jazeera article, “Measuring China’s Motivations in Africa,” and were made when he was serving as Ethiopia’s foreign minister in 2013 as part of the overtly Marxist “Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front” party.Africa is knee-deep in CCP-sponsored “debt trap diplomacy,” a destructive process whereby the CCP lends hefty sums of money to other countries which they can’t pay back. When countries default on the loans, China takes over the projects and amasses additional political and economic power.Look no further than how the Kenyan government was forced to relinquish its Port of Mombasa to China as a result of unpaid debt.Even Hillary Clinton criticized this 21st century economic exploitation, comparing China’s efforts to “new colonialism” while serving as U.S. Secretary of State.And Dr. Tedros’s CCP conciliations aren’t contained to rhetoric; it is replete in his policies, too.Under his watch, China and Ethiopia’s relationship “reached their highest qualitative level” according to a joint press release from Wang Yi, China’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Tedros himself.The CCP hailed the burgeoning relationship as a “real and excellent model for South-South cooperation.”The joint statement barely scratches the surface of China’s economic involvement:China has become the biggest foreign investor and the largest trading partner of Ethiopia. Ethiopia is now one of the main markets in Africa for Chinese products, equipment, technology and investment. Since 2006, China, through various mechanisms, has provided a large amount of financial support for the construction of a number of Ethiopia’s mega projects. These include the first Express Toll Way and the first operative Wind Power Plant, the Addis Ababa Light Track Railway and other modern railways developments as well as the Tirunesh-Beijing Hospital and the Confucius Institute.”In other words, Tedros served as an auxiliary force for China’s quest for economic dominance: effectively selling his own country out.And Dr. Tedros has taken on a similar role in light of the coronavirus pandemic.He’s been accused of being in the CCP’s pocket for undeservedly glorifying the regime’s “transparency,” alongside its “openness to sharing information.”He recently castigated President Trump for the early Chinese travel ban which saved many American lives. At the time Tedros claimed it would “have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit.”As a result, Tedros is a major star in Chinese state media, with sites prominently highlight his CCP-flattering comments.The bias prompted President Trump to halt funding to the WHO, which Tedros oversees.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/who-director-china/
73,Politics,Police Send Lawyer to Psychiatric Facility Following Anti-Lockdown Advocacy,"Police in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg took a lawyer to a psychiatric institution “against her will” where she spent several days following her advocacy against coronavirus-related lockdown measures.Beate Bahner was taken into the facility on Easter Sunday, having asked onlookers to call local police. Bahner is sid to have feared for her own safety, according to German-language media reports, due to her increased profile amidst her anti-lockdown activity.The lawyer – pejoratively referred to as “coronoia” (a play on “coronavirus” and “paranoia”) – originally reported that police manhandled her upon her arrest, causing her to hit her head.They then took her to a local psychiatric institution where she was held until Tuesday.Following her release, Bahner’s story was altered, and she subsequently admits to having been drinking with friends and falling off a bicycle.The incident has caused further consternation amongst those who claim Germany’s reaction to the coronavirus has been excessive.Local news reports are replete with stories of protests, demonstrations, and exasperation about the situation in the European country. German skeptics tell the National Pulse that the measures are draconian, and more of a reflection of a centralized appetite to use the coronavirus crisis to mask national economic failures.Germany’s economy has been teetering on the precipice of recession for the past year.Bahner – a medical lawyer of 25 years and author of five books – wrote a letter on April 3rd announcing a lawsuit against “[T]he measures taken by the federal and state governments,” calling them, “blatantly unconstitutional and [in violation of] a multitude of fundamental rights of citizens in Germany to an extent never seen before.”She concluded in her letter: “This shutdown must be ended immediately!”Her case was rejected, and she wrote: “unfortunately [I have] not succeeded in… saving the liberal-democratic basic order in Germany… from the worst global attack and the lightning-fast establishment of the most inhuman tyranny the world has ever seen.”Bahner is said to have called for a mass demonstration against lockdown measures on Easter Saturday.While she remains under investigation for assault and “resistance to law enforcement officers,” Bahner also led up to 200 demonstrators on Wednesday April 15th, outside a police building in Heidelberg.Bahner and her supporters are said to have hugged each other in response to social distancing demands by authorities. Police used megaphones to attempt to convince the crowd to disperse.VIDEO: The news follows the police dispersal of protesters in North Carolina in the United States this week.According to local news reports: More than 100 protesters rallied in downtown Raleigh to reopen North Carolina on Tuesday, describing Gov. Roy Cooper’s stay-home order as an unconstitutional overreach that will kill the state’s small businesses.At least one protester, Monica Faith Ussery, 51, of Holly Springs, was charged with violating the executive order.“I have a right to peacefully assemble,” she said as officers led her away, her hands bound with a zip tie. “God bless America.”…The protest was organized by ReopenNC, a private Facebook group organized last week that wants people to make their own stay-at-home decisions to avoid exposure to COVID-19 as the worldwide pandemic continues. The group surpassed 28,000 members on Tuesday afternoon.Social media invitations are circulating for similar protests in New York State.The National Pulse has seen one such invitation (below) encouraging a “Peaceful Open-Up Walk Down 5th Ave” scheduled for Saturday, April 18th.“We are ready to take our chance with CV-19,” the invite says, adding: “This is a peaceful walk to encourage our local, state, and federal elected officials to open the economy.”Editor’s Note: The National Pulse does not believe in preemptively exposing the general public to potential infection and urges readers to adhere to national and local guidelines.

74,Politics,Divest. From. China.,"Since 1980, the United States has granted “Most Favored Nation” trading status to China on the condition that they improve their record on human rights as well as play fair regarding international commerce. Despite not living up to those conditions, every president since has granted a waiver maintaining the status for another year, sometimes against the advice of Congress.Presidents Bush and Clinton both supported normalized trade relations with China.“Will we do more to advance the cause of human rights if China is isolated?” Clinton asked in 1994, suggesting that opening trade would encourage more liberalization and freedom in the Middle Kingdom.President Clinton urged Congress to grant permanent trade status to China throughout his presidency. Congress finally agreed in 2000, and President George W. Bush signed the law the following year.Thus began an audacious experiment to change China through trade and openness. Unfortunately, twenty years of hindsight shows it to be a miserable failure.Rather than allowing China to adopt the best of Western culture, open trade has instead brought the worst of China – the gangster political ruling class – to the West.Corporations such as Apple and Google have invested heavily in China, taking advantage of cheap manufacturing as well as for access to the largest developing market on earth.Hollywood and the NBA have also become dependent on the Chinese economy.For all their talk of social justice, cash is still king. While American companies have no problem criticizing US government policies, they tread carefully around China’s record of abuse for fear of losing access to such a lucrative market.Normalized trade has not had the desired effect on the Chinese government.More than three decades after the Tiananmen Square massacre, China is still being accused of some of the most horrific crimes against humanity, from the deliberate genocide of Muslim Uighurs to harvesting organs from political prisoners.What have American citizens gained from this trade relationship? Sure, we’ve got some cheap goods and electronics. But at what cost?Since normalizing trade, China has stolen millions of manufacturing jobs while flooding our cities and towns with deadly drugs such as fentanyl. They have shamelessly copied our intellectual property, hacked our corporate and government computer networks, and have now unleashed a global outbreak that has killed thousands and brought our economy to a standstill.Donald Trump has been urging America to divest from China for a long time.As a businessman, he saw the danger of relying too much on a belligerent regime. As President, he has used tariffs to level the playing field and to urge American companies to bring manufacturing back to our country. The coronavirus pandemic should be the final nail in the coffin of Chinese entanglement: It is time to decouple.Japan is taking the lead on divestment, with their government pledging more than $2 billion to help their companies move their manufacturing away from China. Japan was particularly hard-hit when the pandemic shut down Chinese manufacturing, and Japanese leaders want to avoid being in such a vulnerable position again.Germany, worried about Chinese firms buying up domestic companies facing bankruptcy, strengthened its foreign investment law to prevent hostile takeovers by China or any other nation.“We in Germany and Europe need to have our own competencies and technologies in certain areas,” said economic minister Peter Altmaier.Even the US Department of Justice (DOJ) recognizes the necessity of decoupling from China.This week the DOJ urged the FCC to revoke the license of a Chinese government owned company that provides telecommunications services in the United States.“Today, more than ever, the life of the nation and its people runs on our telecommunications networks,” explained John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security. “Today’s action is but our next step in ensuring the integrity of America’s telecommunications systems.”The American people are starting to demand decoupling from China.Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has introduced bills to return manufacturing to our country, recently signal-boosted a suggestion that Amazon give customers the ability to filter out products that are made in China.Best new idea I’ve heard all day. What about it, @amazon @JeffBezos? https://t.co/QQp33aRyoh— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) April 9, 2020Cheap consumer products have simply not been worth the cost we continue to pay, every day.If given the opportunity, many Americans will gladly follow President Trump’s advice to “buy American and hire American”.It is time we rectify the mistake we made more than twenty years ago and finally end our abusive relationship with China.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/divest-from-china/
75,Politics,New Zealand Politicians Take 20% Pay Cut While U.S. Congress Hands Itself $25M Extra,"New Zealand’s politicians are taking a pay cut in solidarity with those suffering the economic ramifications of coronavirus. U.S. politicians could learn something here.New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, is making ministers in her government and public service chief executives take a 20 percent pay cut for six months due to the impact on their economy.“This is where we can take action and that is why we have,” the Prime Minister added to her statement.“We acknowledge New Zealanders who are reliant on wage subsidies, taking a pay cut and losing their jobs as a result of the global pandemic.”President Trump already gives away his salary. Meanwhile Democrats have focused on funding for the arts, green new deals, diversity programs, funding for Planned Parenthood, and mail-in voting.The U.S. House of Representatives is now working on a part-time basis yet wants full-time benefits.A spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee revealed that at this time of belt-tightening, Congress snuck in $25 million of extra funding for itself:“The funding is to support the House’s capability to telework, including for the purchase of equipment and improvements to the network,” Evan Hollander told us in an email. “It will also provide for reimbursement costs for the staff of the House Child Care Center and covers the costs of the House food service contracts. In addition, it will support the Sergeant-At-Arms on continuity of operations matters.”Try asking your boss for the same deal.Many companies reduced or furloughed their employees during the virus affecting many Americans, yet Pelosi chooses not to lead by example. New Zealand’s leaders lead by taking a pay cut.And let’s not forget what Pelosi said about Congress taking a pay cut in 2013:“I don’t think we should do it… I think it is necessary for us to have the dignity of the job that we have rewarded.”Congress has a base salary of $174,000 a year, more than 3x the median household earns.Not a bad gig considering they work roughly 174 days in a year, equivalent to a thousand dollars a day and a pension plan that guarantees them up to 80 percent of their base salaries. Lifetime congressional workers like Pelosi earn over $230,000 per year.On top of the pay come the perks of the job. They receive a wide selection of health benefits, some of the best plans in the country (and keep them for life), and allowances of over $994,000 for expenses such as travel, office equipment, office rentals, supplies, and free airport parking in D.C. to name a few.If American politicians can’t show some solidarity with the public at the most heinous times, why do we expect them to represent us well when the sun is shining?",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/new-zealand-pay-cut-congress-25m/
76,Politics,"Tedros Lied, People Died: Why Trump’s Right to End W.H.O. Funding","The World Health Organization’s pro-Chinese Communist Party cover-up was so blatant that even the left-wing Wired magazine had to eat crow over it.As Wired reluctantly points out, the evidence that the World Health Organization (WHO) was engaged in malfeasance on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) became sufficiently convincing with merely a tweet.Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇨🇳. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020On January 14th the WHO audaciously and ludicrously claimed there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission present in SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19 disease.Setting aside caveats and jargon, the WHO essentially broadcast to a reliant world that the CCP Virus couldn’t spread from human-to-human. This statement was made 18 days after a group of doctors notified health officials of a disturbing cluster of illnesses. It was made 14 days after both the CCP and the WHO were officially notified.To suggest that WHO merely blew the call—or didn’t know—strains credulity.To find the source of the pro-CCP cover-up, one need look no further than Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Dr. Tedros has a checkered history that makes him the ideal target of CCP influencing campaigns.He was the Health Minister for the Marxist Ethiopian government, a position where he worked closely with China, which invested heavily in Ethiopia in myriad fashion.As part of his tenure, Dr. Tedros allegedly covered up three separate outbreaks of cholera.The New York Times reported a now eerily familiar story in 2017: “United Nations officials said more aid could have been delivered to Ethiopia had the truth been told.”Could more lives have been saved if Dr. Tedros’s WHO had told the truth about the CCP virus? Undoubtably.Wired reported this week: “…the organization could have performed better in the early stages of the contagion, and there’s at least some reason to suspect that people at WHO knowingly and consequentially misled us.”Additionally, as part of the most recent pro-CCP propaganda campaign, Dr. Tedros stated: “China is setting a new standard for outbreak response”.Dr. Tedros may be right.If the WHO is allowed to exist in its currently corrupt state, then a standard of covering up deadly viruses, fudging numbers, and disappearing doctors for trying to spread the truth might indeed become the “new standard.”And the CCP propaganda cannot stop spilling from Tedros’s mouth.""Yesterday, Wuhan, 🇨🇳 reported no new cases for the first time since the #COVID19 outbreak started. Wuhan provides hope for the rest of the world, that even the most severe situation can be turned around""-@DrTedros #coronavirus— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) March 20, 2020The WHO announced on March 20th that China reported no new cases coming out of Wuhan. Evidently, the WHO is the last group of people alive who still believe China is telling the truth about their numbers. They even went so far as to claim China offers hope for the rest of the world.When Dr. Tedros and the corrupt organization he leads were called out by President Trump, the WHO responded with nothing short of blackmail: “Please don’t politicize this virus,” Tedros said. “It exploits the differences you have at the national level. If you want to be exploited and if you want to have more body bags, then you do it.”Tedros is speaking from experience.He politicized this virus in favor of the Chinese Communist Party. Because of him there are over a hundred thousand body bags about to be filled with the loved ones of countless different families around the globe.He cared more about shifting geopolitics in favor of the CCP, and the CCP shared his concern.This is precisely why America should withdraw funding and commit money to forming a new health entity to coordinate responses to epidemics and pandemics in the future. This new organization should stand proudly for Western principles, because those are the only values which can be shared by the world.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/tedros-lied-people-died/
77,Politics,"America Can Take a Stand Against Christian Persecution, Here’s How…","Congress has a decision to make: turn a blind eye to corruption and Christian persecution, or use an impending repatriation of hundreds of millions of dollars laundered to address these issues.Sen. Chuck Grassley is strongly encouraging the latter.The United States and the British Isle of Jersey recently agreed to return over $300 million embezzled by Nigeria’s corrupt former dictator General Sani Abacha, and Sen. Grassley has rightly raised concerns about the absence of “proper safeguards to prevent the further misuse of funds.”Given Nigeria’s decades of raging corruption, any agreement void of meaningful oversight – like granting U.S. officials the authority to conduct investigations, establishing reporting timelines and protocols, or even specifying how the prosecution of further corruption would unfold – is a disaster waiting to happen.The Nigerian government – which consistently ranks among the least free and most repressive countries – would become the sole watchdog for its own corruption.Barring major oversight or transparency mechanisms attached to the release of funds, the U.S. would become a co-conspirator in Nigeria’s persecution of Christians, quashing of press freedoms, and lining the pockets of the elite – the opposite of President Trump’s foreign policy goals.Under current President Muhammadu Buhari, the Economic Financial Crimes Commission – the body intended to root out corruption – has been weaponized into a political persecution machine.The commission detained former Nigerian Attorney and Buhari anti-corruption activist General Mohammed Adoke despite not charging him with a single crime and even denied him medical care. And Senator Shehu Sani, a critic of the Buhari government, has also fallen victim to the EFCC. He recounted his detention, which included “brutal and traumatizing interrogations” to elicit a forced confession, as “hellish, unfair, unjust and a clear breach of his fundamental human rights.”Predictably, the EFCC called Sen. Grassley’s letter “malicious,” brazenly claiming its chairman, Ibrahim Magu, “tackles the menace of corruption without fear or favour.” Magu also touts receiving an award from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for battling corruption as evidence he’s up to the task of ensuring a transparent repatriation of funds.While the FBI is certainly familiar with corruption on its own shores – Crossfire Hurricane and the findings of the Horowitz Report to say the least – it’s allowing the same politically-motivated attacks to spread in Nigeria. Congress shouldn’t let it continue.Especially since the EFCC is just the tip of the iceberg.In a related case, the Buhari government has refused to cooperate with the Department of Justice in transferring an additional $100 million of Abacha’s loot and admitted it would return the repatriated sum to a government official who “was involved in corruption with Abacha” according to DOJ reports.Without any preconditions, the money will be used to line the pockets of the people who stole the money in the first place – not to help the nearly 90 million Nigerians who live in extreme poverty. And even if the funds managed to reach the Buhari government unobstructed, it would be funding a government that continually undermines Nigeria’s already eroded freedom of religion, freedom of speech, due process, and rule of law.The persecution of Christians, of great concern for the United States, has increased dramatically.Nearly 12,000 Christians have been killed for practicing their faith since Buhari came to power in 2015 according to Amnesty International.In the first four months of 2020 alone, an estimated 350 Christians were murdered. Even the State Department is cognizant of this threat.In December, it designated the country as a “severe violator of religious freedom”and placed it on the Special Watch List.Freedom of the press has also deteriorated, and with that, the ability for journalists to hold the government accountable when it inevitably receives the repatriated sum has evaporated.Omoyele Sowore, a human rights activist and reporter, was arrested for daring to report on Buhari’s corruption and countless human rights violations. Despite posting bail, he was immediately re-arrested by the country’s highest judicial authority who claimed he lacked the appropriate power to release Sowore, who’s currently awaiting trial after pressure from U.S. representatives.The list of abuses goes on.The U.S. shouldn’t be complicit in handing over hundreds of millions of dollars to a regime with corruption ad infinitum as its modus operandi and a deplorable track record on human rights.While America certainly shouldn’t be the policeman of the world, this is an easy opportunity to advance the Trump administration’s foreign policy goals and defend the defenseless at no cost to American lives or taxpayer dollars.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/america-against-christian-persecution-nigeria/
78,Politics,UN: Coronavirus Presents ‘Opportunity To Unstereotype Gender Roles’,"The UN is using the coronavirus to push its feminist agenda – disguised as “gender equality” – despite men constituting the overwhelming majority of virus-related deaths.The body is seizing the global pandemic as “a great opportunity to “unstereotype” the gender roles that play out in households” in its new “Gender Equality in the Time of COVID-19” report.The report is chock full of gender-based, identity politics, and claims that “pandemics make existing inequalities for women and girls worse.”This follows the UN’s request for “decision makers to slow down” as an “effective countermeasure to unconscious bias” per the advice of ‘racial justice experts’.”Alongside this push for equality, in classic feminist fashion, the United Nations also champions special treatment for women.Countries need to “ensure that the needs of female nurses and doctors are integrated into every aspect of the response effort” and ensure “at a minimum, this means ensuring that menstrual hygiene products such as sanitary pads and tampons are available for female caregivers and frontline responders as part of personal protective equipment.”This mindset carries over into the post-coronavirus world.“Leaders must find a way to include women in response and recovery decision-making,” the report adds.Concerning the economy, “bailout and stimulus packages must include social protection measures that reflect an understanding of women’s special circumstances and recognition of the care economy.”During crisis, women act as leaders in their communities and in frontline services.Here are 4 unique risks they must manage in the face of #COVID19. pic.twitter.com/0Iw6ecOSI2— UN Women (@UN_Women) March 20, 2020It’s also advising member states to “focus on people, especially the most affected: women, older persons, youth, low-wage workers, small and medium enterprises, the informal sector and vulnerable groups”.While feminists may have coined the term “gender gap,” it has taken on a whole new meaning in light of coronavirus.In Italy and Spain, men accounted for over 70 percent of all coronavirus-related deaths. In New York, coronavirus is claiming male victims twice as often as females.It’s so obvious that even the mainstream media has set their feminist blinders aside to highlight this divide:“Physicians working at hospitals throughout the city say the gender disparity is stark and impossible to miss,” according to The New York Times.The UN also frets about the lack of “family planning and other sexual and reproductive health commodities” that are “central to women’s empowerment” potentially being “impacted as supply chains undergo strains from pandemic response.”In other words, the decades of globalist-sanctioned outsourcing pushed by supranational bodies like the UN have backfired.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/un-gender-roles-coronavirus/

80,Politics,"Biden Said ‘China’s Rise Isn’t Our Demise’… Now 23,000 Americans Are Dead.","Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed in an op-ed for the New York Times: “China’s Rise Isn’t Our Demise.” Now, with nearly 23,000 Americans dead following the attempted Chinese Communist Party cover-up of the coronavirus, it’s time to look back at the would-be president’s claim.In the 2011 op-ed, Biden wrote: “I remain convinced that a successful China can make our country more prosperous, not less,” and concluded, “Some may warn of America’s demise, but I’m not among them. And let me reassure you: based on my time in China, neither are the Chinese.”Over the decade prior to that claim – 2001 to 2011 – the United States lost 2.7 million jobs to China, partly because of Chinese currency manipulation.Courted by cheap labor and low production costs, U.S. CEOs – like heads of the auto industry – increasingly moved their manufacturing companies overseas. By 2010, China passed the United States as the world’s top car market. The gradual dominance of American industry also benefitted from routine intellectual property theft. In 2019, one in five U.S. corporations reported that China’s companies had stolen their intellectual property within the last year. This year, the FBI finally named China as “the biggest law enforcement threat to the United States.” According to bureau director Christopher Wray, “The FBI has about 1,000 investigations involving China’s attempted theft of US-based technology in all 56 of our field offices and spanning just about every industry sector.” William Evanina, director of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center, believes that Chinese theft as it pertains to American trade secrets cost the United States “anywhere from $300bn to $600bn” every year.While American workers saw their wages plummet and their jobs shipped overseas to China, Wall Street corporatists prospered. Take the former Vice President’s son, Hunter Biden. Hunter is one of nine directors at BHR partners, a firm controlled by Chinese government-owned entities. According to reports, “over the past roughly six years, [BHR Partners] has channeled $2.5 billion or more on behalf of its financial backers into automotive, energy, mining and technology deals.” In 2015, BHR joined a $600 million takeover of Henniges Automotive, a Michigan-based automotive industry company, and secured a 49 percent stake as a result of the deal.Despite the Chinese blow to American industry at the expense of working-class people, Vice President Joe Biden continued to applaud government-led Chinese manufacturing.At the Export Import Bank conference in Washington in April of 2013, Biden said: “We have to update the global rules of the road. We have to do it in a way that maximize benefits for everyone, because obviously, it’s overwhelmingly in our interest, this is not a zero-sum game, it’s overwhelmingly in our interest that China prosper.” U.S. Attorney General William Barr disagrees. In his keynote address at the Department of Justice’s China Initiative Conference in 2018, Barr said: “For China, success is a zero-sum game.” He then announced the Justice Department’s China Initiative, “to confront China’s malign behaviors and protect U.S. technology.” According to Barr, the People’s Republic of China “employs a multi-pronged approach: engaging in cyber intrusions, co-opting private sector insiders through its intelligence services, and using non-traditional collectors, such as graduate students participating in university research projects.”The same year Vice President Joe Biden penned his “China’s Rise Isn’t Our Demise” opinion piece for the NYT, Donald Trump – a private citizen at the time – tweeted: “Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy, not a friend.”The novel coronavirus has made it clear that Biden’s history of praise for Chinese Communist Party certainly does not stand the test of time.

81,Politics,BBC Uses Coronavirus to Stop Viewers Cancelling Their ‘Licence Fee’ Payment,"As a result of the coronavirus lockdown, the publicly-funded British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has closed down the part of its website that allows members of the publicto opt out.At a time when trust in Britain’s effective state broadcaster is at an all-time low, and people are trying to cut unnecessary spending from their household budgets, the ‘Beeb’ is refusing to allow cancellations of Britain’s much-derided “television licence”.Although it is now impossible to cancel a TV licence on the BBC’s website., it is not impossible to buy a new one. The coronavirus doesn’t appear to have affected that function.Nor did it affect the ability to review your payment plan, renew an existing licence, make changes to it, or even change the way someone can pay for it. Miraculously none of the functions where the BBC receives money has been affected, just the bit where the BBC must return it. Amazingly enough, the BBC’s ability to send out renewal letters or “reminders” too has escaped the clutches of the virus, and so “customers” can be assured they will receive demands for payment when they fall due.Yes. Or rather, sort of.The establishment would have you believe that you must have a television licence in the United Kingdom, though many have found ways to opt-out over the past few years.If you are in the UK and you watch live television, you are told to pay the BBC a fee which amounts to over $5bn a year in revenue for the liberal-left broadcaster which makes CNN look positively far right. Failure to comply is a criminal offence.For example, in Britain you could be watching “I Love Lucy” on one of the commercial channels. But it doesn’t matter that the program is a repeat, nor that you are watching it on a channel that is a competitor of the BBC. If it is being broadcast live you must still pay the BBC their fee. And if you don’t – criminal prosecution. And if you refuse to pay the fine – imprisonment. Yes, in the UK you can actually go to prison for watching a rerun that’s older than you.In 2013 the BBC reported a tenth of all criminal prosecutions in the UK were for licence fee evasion – 181,000 people.By 2015 the number was 184,595, of which 140,000 were taken to court, where an astonishing 101,000 women were found guilty and 90 were jailed.In 2016, 107,000 women were given a criminal record for failing to pay money to the BBC – amounting to 71.9 per cent of the total number prosecuted.Why are so many women persecuted? The BBC has outsourced the collection of licence fees to a private company called Capita, with remuneration determined upon results, meaning the more licence fee evaders Capita catch, the more money they make. Catching is primarily achieved through intimidation: first a torrent of threatening letters and if that doesn’t work – home visits. Thus it simply makes business sense to target those people more inclined to respond to threats. The BBC proudly “advertises” its Stasi-like enforcement of the licence fee. There was a time the BBC was a widely respected institution. Those days have long gone. It is now an organisation bedeviled by contradiction. British, but ashamed of Britain. Obsessed with diversity, but rigidly singular of mind and thought. Insularity is a sickness that riddles the BBC and although they don’t know it yet, it is terminal. This can perhaps be best illustrated by the fact that on the historic night of Britain leaving the European Union (Something 17.4 million Brits had voted and were waiting for), the BBC was so out of touch that it refused to broadcast the Prime Minister’s speech to the nation. The leader of a Conservative government admittedly disliked by the BBC, but whom the British people had just voted for in a landslide.Britain’s broadcaster has taken a decidedly pro-Chinese Communist Party line throughout the coronavirus pandemic, regurgitating criticisms of President Trump and promoting false Chinese data as accurate.But still, they want you to pay the licence fee, or they’ll send one of the vans around.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/the-bbc-cancels-cancelling-the-bbc/
82,Politics,"SCHILLING: If DOJ Needs More Powerful Porn Laws, Congress Should Pass Them","Pornography has been a hot topic in the news recently, and not just because of coronavirus.Over the past several months, there has been a growing chorus of leaders calling for an increasingly out-of-control porn industry to finally be held accountable. And as more evidence comes in, it could not be clearer that porn use is indeed out of control.The statistics are alarming.Pornography is now more available and popular than ever in history, thanks in large part to the internet. In 2018, the world’s largest porn site registered an average of 92 million visits per day and 5.5 billion hours viewed over the course of the year. In addition to adults, it is making its way into the hands of ever younger viewers: studies have found that large majorities of today’s young adults first encountered porn as adolescents, and that about half of college-aged males first viewed porn before age 13. And the porn of today is far more graphic and violent than in the past: one analysis of online porn content found that 43 percent contained what was characterized as “visible aggression.”It should be no surprise then that more leaders are becoming concerned, and indeed, the Department of Justice has now received a number of letters urging action on the issue. In December, four Members of Congress signed a public letter calling for Attorney General William Barr to enforce existing obscenity law. In January, Professor Robert George of Princeton University sent his own letter calling for the same. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, several conservative groups (including my own, the American Principles Project) have actively pushed DOJ to do more to protect children from online pornography.READ THE REST HERE.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/pass-porn-laws/
83,Politics,Voice of America Parrots Chinese Propaganda At American Taxpayer Expense,"News outlet Voice of America (VOA) is carrying water for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with their novel coronavirus coverage, and American taxpayers are footing the bill. The 1,000-person multimedia operation which “principally serves foreign audiences, with radio and television broadcasts reaching 236.6 million people worldwide in 47 languages” has an operating budget of nearly $220,000,000, entirely tax payer-funded. And with that sizable war chest, despite VOA’s intended job of forging US global media presence, its coronavirus reporting shows its loyalties lie elsewhere: China.This dubious relationship predates the coronavirus crisis and has caught the attention of the Trump administration which recently declared: “VOA too often speaks for America’s adversaries—not its citizens. Journalists should report the facts, but VOA has instead amplified Beijing’s propaganda.”Voice of America Parrots Chinese Propaganda At American Taxpayer Expense https://t.co/Q1v32TjlVb— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) April 13, 2020According to VOA staff, one of the company’s television editors even “publicly pledged his allegiance to China at an embassy event.” Ignore the buried lede that “VOA personalities have hosted events at the [Chinese] embassy [in Washington]” according to reports.Its director, Obama-era appointee Amanda Bennett, has also taken a page out of the CCP’s media playbook, censoring an exclusive interview with CCP whistleblower Guo Wengui and firing or disciplining the journalists who wanted run the clips in full.And company insiders added that VOA’s Mandarin service has “a pattern of avoiding stories that could be perceived to be too tough on China,” a bias on full display in light of coronavirus.They’ve used the CCP’s coronavirus data without questioning the validity of the sham numbers, even creating snappy graphics and social media posts to amplify the reach.In other words, they’re co-conspirators in the CCP’s elaborate propaganda scheme, made possible by your tax dollars.A few examples of the graphics are below: And the articles run by the site toe the same CCP line. In an article “China Objects to Trump’s ‘Chinese Virus’ Tweet,” they provided no rationale as to why that label would make sense and instead only cited officials who disagreed with President Trump, including Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.This is not an isolated incident.Similarly biased and blatantly false coverage was also visible during the pro-democracy Hong Kong protests in 2019. The caption of the picture below indistinguishably parrots CCP propaganda:The Washington Post clairvoyantly commented in 2017 the VOA “could be used to disseminate propaganda,” even though the Post itself has knowingly promoted CCP lies.And it’s certainly living up to that moniker: American tax dollars are hard at work making sure CCP propaganda triumphs over the truth.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/voice-of-america/
84,Politics,WAX: Conservative Inc’s Kid Commentators Are (Again) Attacking the Trump Right,"“I don’t like it when I see GOP lawmakers sharing Breitbart articles,” the Washington Examiner’s Brad Polumbo wrote, alluding to Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. “They’re not a credible source and shouldn’t be boosted.”Polumbo’s tweet garnered more replies than retweets, to the point where Polumbo had to mute his notifications and call anyone who disagreed with his take “alt-right” or “Frog Twitter.” A cursory inspection of the variety of replies shows this to be false.Doubling down on his cowardice, Polumbo proceeded to block any and all opposition he couldn’t handle, including your present author.Compared to the Examiner, Breitbart commands much more engagement and daily visitor time, according to Alexa.Polumbo’s overexertion to appear serious or respectable is telling. Whatever his self-worth, Polumbo can’t go long without making statements like this that ostensibly aim at a target, but also conveniently tell us how he is its noble inverse.But what about his own digital activity?He devoted his first Medium post to the right-wing trickster Jacob Wohl, having tweeted about the “snack” over the past year, as shown here, here, here, here, and here.It’s easy to imagine Polumbo losing his prominence within the respectable Washington, D.C. conservative establishment if his comments were aimed at women. We have rightfully removed the objective sexualization of the fairer sex from our political discourse, so we shouldn’t tolerate it being directed towards men either.Herein lies the larger point about Polumbo: a symbol of the establishment and where it is attempting to steer the grassroots of the movement. This well-heeled force is known as Conservative Inc., made up of the same corporatist flunkies that opposed President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign to the bitter end.Conservative Inc sacrifices any remnant of traditional values or national sovereignty on the altar of managerial capitalism. In exchange, this warmed over neoconservatism promises high-roller support for Republican Party candidates and spokespeople who can rouse just enough of the dissenting college campus youth to perpetuate a facade of legitimate public debate.The youth are lectured at by Conservative Inc, keen to enable unfathomable debt monetization, profligate spending, reckless foreign adventurism, and anti-family and anti-traditional policies. Polumbo, an atheist who says that “either God designed homosexuality or He doesn’t exist,” who calls the ban on transgenders in the military “aggression,” calls for the removal of Confederate monuments, wants major reform of the electoral college, and erroneously downplays the need for border security by hyping gossip reporting from the New York Times.He’s called for the pro-life movement to drop its argument of life from conception and to support, yes support, the “morning after” abortion pill. He’s taken the vacuous position of former Republican Michigan congressman Justin Amash on impeachment of President Donald Trump. What is conserved by these pronouncements? What is advanced? The Polumbo ideal of conservatism is ever-more concern-trolling and gatekeeping, which amounts to no future at all.Thankfully, grassroots leaders like Michelle Malkin are proving that there is another path for the conservative movement. Despite being on the receiving end of Polumbo’s signature “clickbait virtue signaling” attack, Malkin is rising in popularity among the dissident right wing youth.In fact, almost no target of Polumbo’s suffers for long, if at all. His bubble of influence seems on the verge of popping, though probably no one will hear it. May it be so for all of Conservative, Inc.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/conservative-incs-kid-commentator/
85,Politics,Will Mel Gibson’s Passion of the Christ Sequel Be the ‘Biggest Film in History’?,"In February 2004, the controversial film, The Passion of the Christ, co-written, co-produced and directed by Mel Gibson for his company, Icon Productions, was released to enormous acclaim. Church groups throughout the country bought out theaters to see it in groups. Religious leaders debated whether it had an anti-Semitic overtone, for blaming the Jewish rabbis in the film for Jesus’s death. It became one of the most popular and celebrated independent films of all time and the highest-grossing R-rated film until the release of Deadpool (2016). The film was banned in Kuwait and Bahrain, because the religion of Islam forbids the visual depiction of prophets, and in Islam Jesus is considered a prophet. In Malaysia, only Christians were allowed to see it, and only Christian churches were allowed to sell tickets to the film.Though it was shot in the ancient Aramaic language (along with Hebrew and Latin) and then subtitled, the film spoke in the only language that Hollywood understands: It cost $30m to make (paid for by Gibson himself, with an additional $15m for marketing) and grossed over $370m in the United States and over $240m in the rest of the world. That’s more than $600m in total. When it was re-cut and briefly re-released the following year, it earned another half million dollars worldwide. Hollywood paid close attention. Now, more than fifteen years later, Mel Gibson is in pre-production on a new film, The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection, dealing with the 72-hour period between the crucifixion and death of Jesus on Good Friday, and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. Gibson will again direct and co-produce for his company, Icon Productions, with his longtime producing partner Bruce Davey, and he’s co-authoring the new screenplay with Randall Wallace, who also wrote Braveheart, Pearl Harbor, and Heaven is For Real. As with the first film, Resurrection will be shot in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew.Jim Caviezel, who starred in the original film as Jesus, will reprise that role. Gibson must have enormous faith in Caviezel’s ability, since at the time the original film was cast, Caviezel was almost exactly Jesus’s age (33) at his death. Now he’s fifty-one, playing the same character in the 72 hours after the end of the last film. Gibson had hinted in a TV interview with Stephen Colbert in 2016 that part of that three-day period might involve Jesus descending to hell and dealing with the demons there.Gibson plans to release the new film on March 31, 2021, in time for Easter next year. No one is sure yet what we’ll see on the screen at that time, but Caviezel apparently took his role as Jesus seriously enough to later take on the role of Gospel writer Luke in the 2018 film Paul, Apostle of Christ. During interviews for Paul, Caviezel said of Resurrection, “There are things that I cannot say… [but] It’s great…I won’t tell you how he’s going to go about it, but I’ll tell you this much, the film he’s going to do is going to be the biggest film in history. It’s that good.”Caviezel probably hopes the next shoot will be less dramatic than his previous shoot as Jesus. During the original Passion shoot, he was struck by lightning twice (during the Sermon on the Mount scene and the Crucifixion scene). He suffered a separated shoulder when the heavy wooden cross fell on him, experienced hypothermia in the cold Italian winter, and still bears a 14-inch scar from the scourging scene when the whip accidentally hit him and tore open his skin. He was also the only American actor in the international cast.Many of the actors in the original film were deeply moved by the experience and chose to convert to Catholicism after the film was finished. Among the actor converts was the atheist who played Judas Iscariot.If the new film is even half as impactful as the last film, Gibson will still have made a significant statement to the world.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/passion-of-the-christ-sequel-gibson/
86,Politics,Why Can’t Democrats Just Be Normal? ,"The economy has been shut down. The government has taken on massive new powers. A virus of unknown infectivity and lethality rates is running rampant.Given the extraordinary circumstances, it was hard to imagine anybody could think this was a moment for partisanship.Truly, it was the hope of all patriotic Americans that Democrats could find a way to be normal human beings. At least until the crisis expires and things begin to resemble normalcy.Democrats made sure to obliterate those hopes when they tanked a bipartisan CCP Virus relief bill, and just today nixed the idea of more relief for small businesses because they didn’t get their way on funding for their preferred causes, including mail-in ballots which are susceptible to fraud.Sure, the original bill was far from perfect, and Democrats had plenty to be happy about.That bill was set to give businesses desperately needed liquidity, and give the American people some amount of money to tide them over until the government allows them to work again. At least, that was how normal people saw it.Democrats saw it as a tremendous opportunity to score items on their political wish list.Normally, they wouldn’t have the power to accomplish this in the Senate without the support of Republican defections. But these were unique times. The Republicans were short on votes due to multiple Senators being placed in quarantine. And Democrats pounced.They took advantage of Republican absences, crashing a bipartisan bill seemingly negotiated in good faith.The bill Pelosi proposed to replace it was stuffed with asinine elements of the standard Democrat wish list, including the cancelation of all Post Office debt owed to the Treasury, and new carbon emission standards for airlines.Those might have been the more sane requests. Among the even more deranged asks, were the enforcement of racial quotas in private boardrooms.It was one of the most cynical ploys ever perpetrated by a political party, immoral to the highest degree. A genuinely malevolent attempt to hold struggling Americans hostage until they caved to Democrats’ radical, partisan demands. It was one of the most despicable things we have ever witnessed. And I am so glad that Democrats chose to do it.Because, put simply, Democrats are incapable of being normal. Even in times of crisis.It’s a tempting proposition to think about Democrats stepping up when it really matters. It might seem like a worthy exchange. In the short run, it would help people just a moment sooner. And that’s a good thing. But is it really the most good thing that could possibly happen? What’s the end result of a Democrat pretending they’re a normal human being, when they’re obviously not?The end result of that is Democrats avoiding consequences for their actions. They’ll destroy the country in peace and privacy when the American people have restored their usual blind eye to the circus of congress. When the American public gets back on their feet—because that’s what they do—they’ll go back to ignoring the clowns on Capitol Hill in both parties.As the attention of the people wanes, so too do the political consequences of immoral behavior.Rather than sticking all of their favorite hobby horses in one bill of monumental importance, they’ll sneak those same hobby horses into different and less consequential bills. It will all get done, just a little slower. The damage done wouldn’t be nearly so immediate, but it would add up. Eventually, the accumulated wounds would be just as severe as a single blow.Meanwhile, Democrats realized they don’t yet have the political capital to pull this off.The American people will get their relief, delayed only by a moment. It will include some absurd pork, because that’s the nature of government. But the bulk of their insanity will have been thwarted. And more importantly than just getting most of the government largesse out of the bill? The Democrats told each and every American just who they are.Now, it’s incumbent on all of us to believe them.If someone is going to work against me, I want them to move swiftly and clumsily. I want them to snap branches, and fall over their own shoelaces. The Democrats didn’t work against me in particular, but they worked against the American people. They moved swiftly, and they were as clumsy as is imaginable.In November, there will be a tremendous opportunity to punish these Democrats for their actions. They can be removed from office, and they will no longer be in a position to take such craven approaches. This opportunity wouldn’t have existed if Democrats were capable of just being normal.Lead Image Credit: DonkyHotey (Flickr/CC)",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/why-cant-democrats-just-be-normal/
87,Politics,ANOTHER Chinese Govt ‘Reporter’ Lies to Trump in White House Press Room,"Another Chinese Communist Party “reporter” has been found masquerading their true identity and lying to the President of the United States in the White House Press Briefing Room.On Wednesday evening, reporter Ching-Yi Chang told President Trump that he was from Taiwan, not China.But Ching-Yi Chang lied. Just like his Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-colleague Youyou Wang two days ago, as reported by the National Pulse.Before the question, the U.S. President asked Ching-Yi (or Jingyi) “Where are you from?”Ching-Yi responds: “Taiwan”, to which the President responds: “Good.”In reality Ching-Yi represents another Chinese state-run outlet called Dragon Television, owned in turn by Shanghai Media Group, one of the largest state-owned media groups in China.”Reporter” Ching-Yi Chang, told @realDonaldTrump he is from Taiwan yesterday in the White House.He was *born* in Taiwan. But he *works* for Chinese state owned Shanghai Media Group – a propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party.More here: https://t.co/nzHgaU3EpU pic.twitter.com/V8B3946EOb— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) April 9, 2020In 2017 the Christian Science Monitor reported: “Chinese TV viewers can’t get enough of the Trump Show and coverage of America in general, says Ching-Yi Chang, White House correspondent for Shanghai Media Group.”During the interview with CS Monitor, Ching-Yi lashed out at his home nation of Taiwan – now under assault by China. “…[T]here are always drawbacks to democracy,” he claimed, before lambasting the United Kingdom for daring to vote to leave the European Union.Ching-Yi then gloats about Chinese efficiency: “In Washington, expansion of the metro system has been chugging along slowly for years. In China, a project like that would be finished in six months,” reported CS Monitor.On his own Facebook page, Ching-Yi (or Jingyi) refers to himself as a “Chinese” reporter. He posts, about himself: “Although I am the Chinese media reporter most frequently visited by the U.S. President, 2019 is particularly special. I have the opportunity to ask questions on critical trips to Vietnam, Japan and France with Trump, both inside and outside the White House.”The Facebook page oozes antipathy towards President Trump and the United States, with unflattering images of the U.S. President as well as “news reports” for his Mandarin-speaking audience.Ching-Yi’s deceptiveness can be followed in the transcript of the exchange between him and President Trump from the White House Briefing Room on Wednesday:Ching-Yi: We know many people around the world are paying close attention.President Trump: Where you from?Reporter: I’m from Taiwan.Obviously, President Trump was not enquiring as to where Ching-Yi was born, but to the news outlet he was representing.Ching-Yi – previously of the same Phoenix TV outlet represented by the other Chinese propagandist found masquerading as a reporter this week – didn’t want to disclose that, because it would reveal that he was yet another CCP propagandist inside the White House Press Briefing Room, and would highlight how Chinese operatives are within feet of the President of the United States.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/another-ccp-reporter-white-house-trump/
88,Politics,What’s More Racist: ‘Chinese Virus’ or the CCP’s Colonization of Africa?,"Rep. Judy Chu (D-California) recently told CNN that it is ‘dangerous’ for the President to refer to Covid-19 as the ‘Chinese Virus’.“He is creating more xenophobia every single time he does that. And we can see the results in what’s happening to Asian Americans across the country.”A recent BBC article examined how the ‘virus of prejudice’ is manifesting in the nation of Kenya. It cited several recent examples, such as a viral video of an Asian man and woman being bullied by a large crowd in the capital of Nairobi.The BBC explains such prejudice is rooted in the economic relationship between the two countries: “Kenya has borrowed a large amount of money from China for big infrastructure projects. While the ordinary Kenyan is not feeling the benefit, they are looking for someone to blame for their economic woes”.This interpretation completely misses the forest for the trees.The forest, in this case, is the enduring criticism that China has long been engaging in “new colonialism” with respect to Africa. But isn’t colonialism supposed to be considered racist?The Communist Party of China first began planting its proverbial seeds in Africa shortly after its rise to power in 1949. It lobbied African nations extensively to recognize its government and soon began building infrastructure across the continent in return.The hidden reason for this, according to Forbes, was the power vacuum that remained after Western colonial powers began to wane. The continent “was still the same stockpile of natural resources its always been”, thus China wasted no time in “laying the political and economic inroads” in order to position itself for the future.Ironically, even former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned of this new colonialism of Africa by China.“We saw that during colonial times it is easy to come in, take out natural resources, pay off leaders and leave,” said Clinton in 2011.But what began as political partnerships and infrastructure projects has led to recurring accusations of “debt trap diplomacy”.Essentially, China has become a global creditor, secretly lending to other countries who end up saddled with hidden debt.This can result in being forced to “sign over national territory or make steep concessions if they can’t meet liabilities”.Kenya itself provides a glaring example of debt trap diplomacy. In 2019, it faced pressure to forfeit its “lucrative Port of Mombasa to Chinese companies” as a result of unpaid debt.Perhaps this has something to do with the BBC’s claim that the “ordinary Kenyan” is “looking for someone to blame for their economic woes”. Perhaps any backlash is more of a reflection of China’s exploitation of Kenya than fear of Covid-19?With respect to Kenya, what is more racist: local taxi drivers not picking up Chinese nationals; or, the government of China colonizing Africa?Furthermore, what shows greater prejudice: President Trump acknowledging the outbreak originated in Wuhan, China; or, the government of China suppressing information about the outbreak and jeopardizing the health of people around the world?The media’s overuse of the term ‘racism’ gives the public a distorted view of current events. This can be seen in CNN’s narrative that calling COVID-19 a “Chinese Virus” has catalyzed an uptick in xenophobia against people of Asian descent.What this fails to account for, however, is the Chinese Communist Party’s role in the current pandemic. It did indeed cover up the outbreak at the time of its genesis.As a result, the CCP put billions of people at risk. This includes Asian-Americans. It includes Kenyans. In fact, it includes any combination of intersectional subgroups that one could possibly conceive.Perhaps the Chinese Communist Party should be the one defending itself against allegations of racism.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/racist-chinese-virus-ccp-africa/
89,Politics,"POLL: Americans Back Trump on China, Demand Corporates ‘Pull Back’","New Harris polling has revealed a hardening of Americans’ views on China and how the Chinese Communist Party should be dealt with on the back of the coronavirus outbreak.Eighty-six percent say their opinion of a company improves if that “Company promises to relocate their manufacturing away from China and back to the United States”.That’s higher than the 84% who back company executives forgoing salaries, bonuses, or other compensation.Seventy-two percent of Americans do not believe China was accurate in its reporting on the coronavirus, while nearly three quarters of voters say they are in favor of Trump’s tough trade policies as they relate to China.Just over half (54%) of Americans believe China should be required to pay other countries for the spread of the virus, while just 17% of voters think President Trump should soften his position on China. Fifty percent say he should get tougher, while 33% say his position should stay the same as it has always been.Asked if American companies should continue to manufacture goods in China, 71 percent of Americans said American corporates should pull back, while just 29% say they should continue in China.Finally, asked if it is proved that China falsely reported on cases and deaths related to the coronavirus, 37% of Americans believed President Trump should unilaterally impose sanctions and 43% said Congress should vote on sanctions.Just 19% said no action should be taken.The numbers were also drilled into by the Washington Post‘s Josh Rogin, who reported:Ninety percent of Republicans said the Chinese government is responsible for the spread of the virus, compared to 67 percent of Democrats. Only 22 percent of Republicans and 34 percent of Democrats said they thought the Chinese government reported their coronavirus statistics accurately.……71 percent of Republicans responded that China should pay other countries in some way for the damage done because of the outbreak, only 41 percent of Democrats felt that way.…A firm majority of Republicans, 66 percent, said Trump should take an even tougher position on China than he currently does. Among Democrats, 38 percent said Trump should be tougher, 23 percent said he should be softer and 38 percent said he has it about right.It’s clear that while the World Health Organization and others continue to run interference for China, the American public is not so shy about calling out the evident wrongdoing by the CCP.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/americans-trump-china-corporates/
90,Politics,World Health Org Ignored Early Warning Over Human-to-Human Coronavirus Transmission to Appease China,"The World Health Organization ignored questions about novel coronavirus human-to-human transmission in December, ostensibly to avoid angering the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).WHO’s status as a CCP puppet dates back to the beginnings of the outbreak: “When Taiwan wrote to the WHO in late December asking whether there was human-to-human transmission in the virus outbreak in Wuhan, the who, the body now admits, did not reply,” according to the Economist.While Taiwan sought information that would have increased health officials’ ability to respond appropriately to the virus, the WHO failed them, placing China’s territorial ambitions over the health of Taiwanese citizens.This follows a bizarre video call where a Taiwanese reporter asked Senior WHO Official Bruce Aylward if the organization would consider granting Taiwan membership – a logical conclusion given the country’s comprehensive coronavirus response, even earning it high marks from CNN.Aylward doesn’t answer, citing technical difficulties as his excuse, and asks the report to skip to the next question before ending the call. Once the call reconnects, the reporter asked Aylward to discuss Taiwan’s virus response, to which he parrots CCP talking points, likening Taiwan to a Chinese territory.Senior WHO official won't answer question on Taiwan, the call drops, then he is asked again and says Taiwan is an ""area of China"" and ends the call again. Wow. https://t.co/1MIQzqxOAu— Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) March 28, 2020The antagonism between China and Taiwan emanates from the CCP’s belief it has the right to assert control over Taiwan and the surrounding South China Sea, but the island nation, a democratic state with countless freedoms absent in China, wants to remain independent. Accordingly, China has thwarted Taiwanese admission into the United Nations, demonstrating the body’s subservience to the CCP.And the UN’s kowtowing to China has been on full display in light of the coronavirus pandemic with the body, which oversees the WHO, falsely praising the regime for its “transparency” and condemning President Trump’s China travel ban as “increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit.”Important reporting from @TheEconomist. @WHO has admitted it did not even REPLY to Taiwan officials raising concerns in late DECEMBER over possible human to human transmission in the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan.

Britain has discovered a capability gap.#WarRoomPandemic #CCPVirus #30DaysToSaveAmerica 👉https://t.co/HuZDFNTwiv pic.twitter.com/A0JgfLnBGL— War Room: Pandemic ☣️ (@WarRoomPandemic) April 7, 2020Prof. Ferrari had only started his EU stint in January, and was due to serve a four year term.The Financial Times reported Ferrari’s words Tuesday afternoon: “I have been extremely disappointed by the European response to Covid-19… I arrived at the ERC a fervent supporter of the EU [but] the Covid-19 crisis completely changed my views, though the ideals of international collaboration I continue to support with enthusiasm.”According to the FT:The ERC, set up in 2007 to fund Europe’s best scientists, has become one of the world’s most prestigious funding agencies with a budget of around €2bn a year. Prof Ferrari, an Italian-American pioneer of nanomedicine, said his rift with the European Commission started in early March “as it became evident that the pandemic would be a tragedy of possibly unprecedented proportions”.He said he proposed then to set up a special ERC programme to combat Covid-19.“I thought that at a time like this, the very best scientists in the world should be provided with resources and opportunities to fight the pandemic, with new drugs, new vaccines, new diagnostic tools, new behavioural dynamic approaches based on science, to replace the oft-improvised intuitions of political leaders,” he said.But the ERC Scientific Council, its governing body, unanimously rejected the idea, he said, on the grounds that its remit allows it only to fund “bottom-up” research proposed by scientists, rather than larger “top-down” programmes with objectives set by EU leaders.“I argued that this was not the time for scientific governance to worry excessively about the subtleties of the distinctions between bottom-up versus top-down research,” said Prof Ferrari, who spent much of his career as a prominent cancer researcher in the US.Speaking Tuesday morning on the War Room: Pandemic radio show, National Pulse Editor-in-Chief Raheem Kassam noted the EU’s poor response to the coronavirus crisis, leaving member states like Italy and Spain to deal with the pandemic alone.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/eu-chief-scientist-resigns-coronavirus/
92,Politics,UN Tells Coronavirus Decision Makers To ‘Slow Down’ To Address Institutional Racism,"The United Nations Human Rights Council has urged decision makers to “slow down” in their response to the coronavirus, ostensibly as a means to combat “racism”. A “Racial Equity and Equality” report lectures UN member nations, claiming the “pandemic requires understanding, rather than denying, diversity.”The guidance comes from the UN’s “Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent,” a committee formed in 2002 that seeks to “propose measures to ensure full and effective access to the justice system by people of African descent.”The hyper-progressive body previously argued America owed “reparations” to people of color for “racial terrorism.”The statement, entitled ‘Racial Equity and Racial Equality Must Guide State Action,’ makes it clear: social justice-inspired activism doesn’t cease even amidst a global pandemic.Concerning the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, the body encourages member states to “commit to equity in the current public health crisis and to recognize the current risk that the historical exploitation of the bodies and resources of people of African descent poses to decision-making.”Adding, “Structural racial discrimination may further exacerbate inequality in access to health care and treatment leading to racial disparities in health outcomes and increased mortality and morbidity for people of African descent.”The committee laments that “no protection efforts have centered public health issues specific to people of African descent” and that “the research and knowledge production developed in response to this crisis may fail to investigate specific barriers to care, or recognize the racially discriminatory intent or impact of policy.”And even states that attempt to address the crisis in a “colorblind” fashion are not immune from UN condemnation: “Interventions that appear neutral on their face may license or facilitate racial bias and stereotypes, without care and attention.”The UN also thinks identity politics should drive hospitals’ response to the virus.To ensure triage policies don’t “result in racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, or other discrimination,” the UN wants already over-burdened decision makers to “slow down” as an “effective countermeasure to unconscious bias” per the advice of ‘racial justice experts’.”The committee explains: “Instructions to doctors that time, data, or consultation is a ‘luxury’ in critical triage decision-making fails to appreciate how social conditioning perpetuates institutional racism and how the lack of protocols or even instructions to be aware of assumptions based on race – particularly at its intersections with disability, chronic illness, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity, and poverty – may impair racial equity in COVID-19 response.”The UN’s nonsensical suggestions continue, suggesting the “use of incarcerated people to produce equipment for the pandemic response, to dig graves, or for other means, without adequate protection against risk or vulnerability, and at substantial cost savings to States, is exploitative of people of African descent and reflect ongoing institutional racism.”Despite the UN’s crusade against racist coronavirus policies, the guidelines epitomize the exact policies they’re warning against: focusing on a specific racial group at the expense of another.They focus solely on workers of African descent who don’t have the ability to protect their health by self-quarantining, when in reality, that problem faces citizens of all nations regardless of their race: “In many States, people of African descent disproportionately serve as home health aides, carers, and grocery and delivery personnel who help hospitals and health care systems focus on the most serious cases, despite no public efforts to ensure their safety and protection.”“In this respect, the treatment of people of African descent serving in this crisis as disposable recalls historical exploitation and implies a social mindset that may fail to critically analyze the assumptions it makes about the needs and the risks to people of African descent in this crisis,” the guidance continues.The UN is proving their real raison d’etre once again: to push a progressive social agenda on the world.It’s certainly not to serve as a check against nations that abuse human rights or prevent the outbreak of deadly infectious diseases.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/un-response-slow-down-racism/
93,Politics,The Left Exploits Coronavirus to Open Borders and ‘Abolish ICE’,"The left loves exploiting a crisis. Horrific school shooting? “An opportunity to ban guns!” Forest fires in California? “Let’s destroy American industry and pass a Green New Deal!” Coronavirus? “Abolish immigration controls!”The original “Abolish ICE” movement was popularized in by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) when she stood next to a fence of a parking lot and cried for the cameras. Before @AOC hit the national stage & was just a fairly unknown House candidate frm NYC,she took time awy frm her campaign & came dwn to #Tornillo to protest the #tentcity housing migrant children.I made these previously unpublished fotos a yr ago today. #elpaso #aoc #onassignment pic.twitter.com/SWyyI1XVt9— Ivan Pierre Aguirre (@i_p_a_1) June 25, 2019You’d think a pandemic caused by a foreign virus might be bad news for the open borders crowd. They certainly don’t seem to think so. The latest strategy is to claim detention facilities are unsafe. Predictably, the establishment media has bought the story. A leading group in the “Abolish ICE” movement recently told CNN that as detainees felt like “sitting ducks.” They cited unnamed detainees to lend credence to these assertions. But while CNN has admitted they were unable to verify the claims, the outlet inexplicably chose to publish them anyway. Other outlets have run stories of hunger strikes despite ICE’s explicit denial of their veracity.What these stories really show is a coordinated effort by activists to capitalize on a crisis in order to target ICE and other federal agencies keeping America safe. Activists have gone so far as to encourage rioting and unrest in order to attempt to force the wholesale release of detainees. Moreover, their true aims become especially clear when one considers that the recent legal action taken by the ACLU and other groups is, in fact, part of a much larger lawsuit against ICE that was filed way back in August of last year.While anti-ICE activists mount drive-by protests and advocate for the release of all detainees, they omit a multitude of critical facts that simply don’t square with their narrative. For starters, 51 percent of ICE detainees are convicted criminals. As the coronavirus pandemic has already put additional strain on our first responders, it should be unconscionable to release thousands of criminals back onto our streets.Furthermore, the notion that these detainees are being held in inhumane conditions is patently false. While Ocasio-Cortez and her cohort have condemned the recent stimulus package—which included $350 million for refugee resettlement but nothing for the Border Patrol or ICE—for focusing on American citizens and excluding illegal immigrants, the truth of the matter is that detainees in ICE facilities all receive round-the-clock medical care paid for by our tax dollars. If these detainees were to be released, it is doubtful that they would be able to find the same level of treatment, especially as many of our hospitals deal with overcrowding and a lack of critical supplies. While open-borders activists continue to call for the release of illegal immigrants detained in these facilities, they haven’t planned further ahead. What should be done about the high percentage of these detainees that are convicted criminals? Who will provide the same level of care, including medical care, shelter, and hygiene products, to replace that offered by ICE? And how will we mitigate the stress on our already strained healthcare infrastructure and resources that would be caused by the detainees’ release? Progressives didn’t have answers for these questions prior to the crisis, and they certainly don’t have the answers now. But pesky issues such as these have never deterred the radical left before.With a pandemic raging around us, they’ve discovered that the best opportunity to accomplish their goals may be now. For those of us looking to avoid an even greater crisis, let’s hope they don’t succeed.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/left-coronavirus-open-borders-ice/
94,Politics,Is Huawei ‘Gifting’ PPE In Exchange for 5G Contracts?,"Huawei has gifted “millions of protective masks and gloves to Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Poland, Greece and Switzerland,”as Reuters reported.But there’s more to this generosity than meets the eye, as asserted by Congressman Mark Green (R-TN), who told Fox News this week: “In France, we were told yesterday on a conference call that [French President Emanuel] Macron was talking to [Chinese President] Xi and Macron asked for a billion masks, and Xi said, ‘We’ll give them to you if you implement 5G with Huawei.’ That’s who China is and it’s time the world wake up and recognize it.”We must increase our strategic stockpiles and fix our reliance on China– the country that started this virus– for our Nation's supply of medications and medical supplies. Joined @LelandVittert on @ANHQDC to discuss: pic.twitter.com/EXqe6C5Jut— Rep. Mark Green (@RepMarkGreen) April 4, 2020To skeptics, Huawei’s efforts illustrate an attempt to secure lucrative 5G contracts amidst new January EU guidelines – which block Huawei from developing critical infrastructure networks. In response to the accusations, Huawei spokesman Joe Kelly said, “a small minority may have misunderstood our motives, which are simply to help people when and where we can.”Quick to defend Huawei’s generosity, the European Union’s Industry Chief, Thierry Breton, condemned public accusations of any supposed ulterior motive replying: “Now the epicenter of the pandemic is in Europe… of course we welcome the fact that the Chinese government is saying ‘how can we return the help.’” It now appears Breton spoke too soon. Huawei is a telecommunications equipment giant and the world’s second-largest smartphone supplier behind Samsung. Founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, Huawei today employs nearly 200,000 people across the globe. Mr. Ren Zhengfei himself belongs to China’s Communist Party and served as a military officer in the People’s Liberation Army for nine years. According to Huawei, “When Ren Zhengfei was a young man, you needed to be a Communist Party member to have any position of responsibility.” Therein lies the problem. To be a successful businessman in China, you have to toe the party line.Reviews conducted by the Wall Street Journal corroborate the speculated Huawei-Beijing alliance. Starting out as an unknown phone switch vendor, Huawei has metamorphosized into the world’s largest telecommunications equipment company in the blink of an eye. Facilitated by grants, credit facilities, tax breaks, and other forms of financial assistance, Huawei’s rise stemmed from generous government backing. Analysts report that Huawei’s charitable financing terms “undercut rivals’ prices by some 30%” Huawei’s allegiance to Beijing is particularly alarming considering the Chinese Communist Party’s egregious human rights record. In the Xinjiang province, China’s imprisons much of its minority Muslim population. According to The Hill, “within Xinjiang, Chinese authorities have built a system of unmatched surveillance and social control facilitated by facial recognition scans, voice biometric data, DNA collection, and artificial intelligence for racial profiling.” Recently, reports have surfaced tying Huawei to the CCP’s repression efforts. According to United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, Huawei poses “massive security and privacy risks.” Fearful of Huawei’s desire to dominate the global 5G network and thus infiltrate our allies’ countries, Pompeo warns: “With 5G capabilities, the CCP could use Huawei to steal private or proprietary information or use kill switches to disrupt critical future applications like electrical grids and telesurgery centers.” Attorney General William Barr also sounded the Huawei alarm during a speech he gave at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in February stating: “Much of the discussion on the dangers of allowing China to establish dominance in 5G has been focused on the immediate security concern of using communications networks that China can monitor and surveil. That is, in fact, a monumental danger.”Lauded as the future of wireless network technology, experts believe 5G will radically revolutionize the way people live and work. Rolled out in 2018 and still relatively new, 5G already shows incredible promise. Able to accommodate a large number of connected devices at once and 10 times faster than 4G LTE, technology specialists predict that 5G will usher in a wave of new, cutting-edge technology. Some even believe 5G could eventually become 100 times faster than 4G – in other words, “fast enough to download a two-hour movie in fewer than 10 seconds, versus around 7 minutes with 4G.” U.S. intelligence officials believe the increasing prevalence of 5G will only accelerate Huawei’s ability to covertly access mobile-phone networks around the world as well as bolster the CCP’s affinity for intellectual property theft.The Chinese Communist Party hid the novel coronavirus from the world and should suffer the consequences, not use Huawei to gain from it. Will members of the mainstream media give as much credence to China’s quid pro quo as they did Trumps alleged? Don’t hold your breath.

97,Politics,Liberty in the Time of Corona: Governments Expanding Citizen Surveillance in the Name of Public Health,"Increasingly authoritarian ideas are being taken as “slowdown” measures against the coronavirus pandemic.The technological panopticon – mooted by governments worldwide to track our movements – is a direct attack on civil liberties as we have known them.Albania, Belgium, Italy, the United Kingdom, Israel, Poland, Argentina, Germany, and more have begun to implement frameworks with telecom companies to track and gather data on individuals to limit social interaction and the spread of the COVID-19 virus.The Washington Post reports that Facebook and Google will also work with the U.S. government to explore the usage of personal data to map social contacts in “anonymized” fashion.These companies are reportedly are also helping other countries to fight the virus, by offering their capabilities of tracking locations of users.In Austria, a tracking app is expected to provide surveillance of virus spreaders. It will notify everyone who was in contact with a positive-tested person from weeks past, requiring them to be tested.In case there are people without smartphones (around two million in Austria), the government will issue a “Schlüsselanhänger” or keychain tag, which non-smartphone users will be required to wear.Government-mandated apps are already welcoming visitors at the border gates of airports in Hong Kong where the StayHomeSafe app is installed, linked to a wristband.Whether on the issue of storage access or location tracking, Janis Wong and Gerry Chan, a doctoral researcher and a professor at the University of St Andrews and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, claim that there is no transparency currently on the restrictions these kinds of apps would have.China – famous for its draconian measures – introduced similar measures to log names and contacts of individuals and also to limit their movements outside of their homes.The Alipay Health Code app is not only mandatory but gives people quarantining status and shares location of civilians with the local police.The BBC reports similar measures in South Korea, where people get notification of the latest incidents and exact locations of new COVID cases.Russia is doubling down efforts, mandating residents register at a municipality website, providing personal photos and addresses before they conduct any move outside of their apartments and home. The user receives a barcode by text message as authorization in case the police stop them. Additionally, Moscow will rely on CCTV to track individuals using facial recognition to make sure the infected stay off the streets.In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the government took a dramatic approach, publicly naming individuals who break quarantine. Montenegro took a similar approach, publicizing the names of individuals diagnosed who have left quarantine. In the case of Armenia, the parliament adopted laws to surveil all citizens, mandating telecommunications companies to provide authorities with locations, meta data, phone calls, and text messages, reports Human Rights Watch.The list of the countries is endless and the normalization of surveillance during the times of crisis is not a surprise.This time around however, decisions are made in front of the public, where everyone can observe the fading of our civil rights.The fear of civil rights advocacy groups is the institutionalization of these emergency measures i.e. their use even after the current crisis. Edward Snowden raised his concerns regarding the developments, stressing the progress and continuation of these measures after the pandemic.“Privacy is the first to go when there are national security issues,” said Ashkan Soltani, a former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist who covered the Snowden revelations as a journalist.More than 100 civil society groups have signed a joint statement, setting out conditions which should be required before using surveillance techniques against the pandemic.While governments are under pressure to act and use most of their capabilities to combat the virus, our options are either to trust the public and private sectors cooperation blindly, or spread the information regarding this issue, contact our representatives and help the groups advocating for our rights.The key points civil rights advocacy groups agree upon include transparency; the ability to reverse or retract the measures; expiry of such powers; anonymisation of data; and more.We, the people, must be on heightened alert against the increasingly authoritarian measures being taken in the name of public safety and healthcare preparedness.If not, the pre-coronavirus world may be the last time any of us recall real privacy and civil liberties.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/civil-liberties-in-the-age-of-corona/
98,Politics,VALENTINE: Will Office Workers Ever Go Back?,"As the internet was taking root in the 1990s, people dreamed of a future where work could be done anywhere. The days of putting on a tie and commuting an hour to work at a desk in an office would give way to enjoying a relaxed morning and commuting twenty feet to the home office thanks to the wonders of broadband, it was predicted.It didn’t happen, at least for most people who work behind a desk. In fact, in many ways the opposite happened.Whereas it was once thought that people would leave congested cities to work remotely in small towns and the countryside, big cities like Seattle, Denver, and Washington, D.C. have actually become more overcrowded as people flock to office jobs there.Rural areas and small towns have suffered to the gravitational pull of big city-based employers. While some employers allowed flexible remote work, either part or full-time, most didn’t.That is, until now.For millions of Americans who work behind a desk – and are blessed enough to still have a job – stay-at-home orders in states around the country have forced employers to allow their people to work from home.A computer, email account, phone, and a decent internet connection are really all that’s needed.The meme is true: that meeting really could have been an email. And if it really couldn’t be an email, modern internet infrastructure means face-to-face group contact is still possible over video applications like Zoom and Skype.In the meantime, roads are clearing up and rush hour is becoming an unpleasant memory.Many states and localities are taking advantage of this to do much-needed roadwork. Workers are getting more sleep at night and spending more time with their families. To be sure, people who haven’t done it before are taking time to adjust, and maintaining focus and productivity may be difficult for some if they’re not in an office. But many people are learning they can get just as much done at home, and with less stress, than commuting to an office.Eventually the coronavirus crisis will be over, and office work will be possible again.The hardcore extroverts among us will welcome the words: “report back to the office.” But many people will return to the long commutes in traffic and the 9-5 slog and find it more draining than ever. Will employers be able to put the genie back in the bottle and tell people who have successfully worked from home for weeks or months that they have to go back to the way things were?I don’t think so. In fact, some companies may not even want to go back.For those of us who have worked remotely for years, an internet connection, focus, and sometimes a bit of extra effort to maintain constant communication make remote work just as productive as office work. Occasional or regular visits to the office are always possible to ensure communication and bonding.Now that millions of Americans have experienced the freedom of remote work, they should have more power to negotiate flexible arrangements. Maybe it can be three days in the office, two at home. Maybe it can be three weeks in the office for every one week at home. Maybe it can even be full-time remote with monthly or quarterly trips to the office.People will save precious hours sitting in traffic and be less stressed while spending more time with their families. They’ll be able to work from the beach or a mountaintop on a working vacation, without the employer even knowing or caring as long as the work gets done. Some may even leave congested cities altogether, and small towns and rural areas will grow again.Once you’ve experienced the freedom of working from home, it’s hard to go back. The potential of a remote revolution may be one of the few good things to come out of the coronavirus crisis. Here’s hoping.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/will-office-workers-ever-go-back/
99,Politics,GOP Rep Authors Bill to Allow Prosecution of China over COVID-19 Outbreak,"Rep. Lance Gooden introduced the Stop COVID Act, designed to give the Department of Justice the ability to hold the Chinese Communist Party responsible for the novel coronavirus if it is proved they manufactured the deadly disease.The bill – short for “Stop China-Originated Viral Infectious Disease Act” – will “give our legal system the power to investigate the origin of the virus and, if found guilty, hold accountable those responsible for creating and releasing it,” according to Rep. Gooden.It would reverse China’s current “immunity from US litigation, even if it becomes known that China manufactured this deadly virus,” a result of the Foreign Service Immunities Act (FSIA) restriction against the federal government suing another nations.The proposal would amend the 1976 restriction, adding that other countries “shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States in any case where such foreign state is found, whether intentionally or unintentionally, to have discharged a biological weapon … in the United States or such discharge results in the bodily injury of [a] United States citizen.”          (function() { var scribd = document.createElement(""script""); scribd.type = ""text/javascript""; scribd.async = true; scribd.src = ""https://www.scribd.com/javascripts/embed_code/inject.js""; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(""script"")[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(scribd, s); })()        While the exact source of the virus is still to be determined, the possibility that it was a bioweapon or vaccine, hasn’t been disproven.In fact, Britain’s government is increasingly skeptical of China’s explanation of the origins of the disease, with senior UK government sources saying the theory the virus was a leak from a laboratory in the Chinese city is “no longer being discounted.”Rep. Gooden added “I’m not ruling anything out. The CCP has lost whatever credibility they had in their handling of this outbreak. The conclusions on the virus’ origin need to be based on the best science, and we’ll never get that if we rely on their investigations.”The Stop COVID Act will give our Justice Department the authority it needs to shed light on this pandemic.I’m calling on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.  #StopCOVIDActhttps://t.co/k1OgpyHF3D— Lance Gooden (@Lancegooden) April 3, 2020Rep. Gooden is right to not trust the CCP.The regime’s initial response to the virus was to suppress doctors who raised concerns over the virus, forcing them to report to the Public Security Bureau and admit to “making false comments” that had “severely disturbed the social order.”Similarly, a University of Southampton study concluded a 95 percent reduction in global coronavirus cases would have resulted if the CCP addressed the virus in its infancy.And this extensive coverup has been corroborated by U.S. intelligence reports which show China “concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its country, under-reporting both total cases and deaths it’s suffered from the disease.”In other words, China’s promises the virus isn’t leaked don’t mean much.According to the group spearheading a class-action lawsuit against China for spawning the virus, the Wuhan Institute of Virology “handles the most dangerous viruses. It resides in the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan. In that lab, they cultivate viruses from exotic animals. The wet markets were supposed to be shut down years ago and the Chinese government turned a blind eye to the ongoing operations. This is not coincidental.”While Democrats push for a 9/11 Commission to chastise President Trump’s pandemic response, Rep. Gooden and his Republican counterparts are putting Americans first, setting up a viable pathway for reparations from China.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/stop-covid-act/

American companies Chubb and Walmart also contributed, and FedEx comped shipping fees.A LinkedIn post described the event:Meanwhile, China’s reaction to the onset of the pandemic was to poach vast quantities of medical supplies from other countries.A company insider at the Chinese Communist Party affiliated developer Greenland Group exposed the operation: “Basically all employees, the majority of whom are Chinese, were asked to source whatever medical supplies they could” including “bulk supplies of surgical masks, thermometers, antibacterial wipes, hand sanitizers, gloves and Panadol.”And that’s coming from the same regime that insists on“global cooperation” to combat the pandemic it caused.American hospitals are already experiencing considerable scarcities of masks and other equipment, expected to grow in the coming weeks.According to even the Washington Post: “Nearly 90 percent of U.S. mayors who responded to a national survey on coronavirus preparedness said they lack sufficient tests kits, face masks and other protective equipment for their emergency responders and medical workers, while 85 percent said they do not have enough ventilators for their hospitals — critical shortages that could lead cities and towns to be quickly overwhelmed should the virus spread through their communities.”To put the number in context, Washington, D.C.’s burn rate of masks is 1,486,656 per month.Some hospital workers have even been forced to create make-shift masks from office supplies.In other words: two million masks would have made a profound difference.The George and Barbara Bush Foundation are keen to make clear that it is another foundation run by members of the Bush family — the George H.W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations, which is responsible for this donation.Both entities name Neil Bush — son of George H.W. Bush — on their board. Both entities are officially affiliated with the Bush family.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/bush-masks-china/
101,Politics,China Took Medical Supplies From Switzerland Despite European Shortages,"With the help of the Chinese Communist Party, a group called the China-Switzerland Connection commandeered personal protective equipment from Swiss suppliers in the midst of Europe’s catastrophic shortage. This is the latest example of China guzzling up vital medical supplies at the expense of other countries: a whistleblower at the CCP affiliated developer Greenland Group revealed employees were tasked with “sourcing bulk supplies of surgical masks, thermometers, antibacterial wipes, hand sanitizers, gloves and Panadol for shipping” and a second Chinese behemoth, Country Garden, poached over 90 tons of equipment from Australia.It certainly goes against the CCP’s narrative that it is spearheading “global cooperation” in light of the virus outbreak its extensive coverup helped spawn.And the regime’s actions in Switzerland were no different.As the novel coronavirus pandemic began ramping up, especially throughout Europe, representatives from the China-Switzerland Connection began targeting Swiss mask suppliers despite the organization’s purported mission of “promoting friendship, understanding and cultural exchange” between the countries.It started the sourcing mission before Europe’s wide-scale shortages struck: “Because we were quite early with our shipment, there were still some shops in Switzerland who still had masks on stock,” according to the organization’s president Carli Beeli.His description continued: “I checked a dozen shops and called them by phone to make sure that they really had the masks on stock. One morning, I was calling yet another shop and they told me they still had a fair amount of valveless 3M FFP2 and FFP3 masks available. I didn’t really have funding available, but I decided to buy all they had on stock.”The organization sourced such extensive amounts of supplies, including donations from France, it organized three separate shipments.Hainan Airlines, which retains the CCP’s provincial government in Hainan as its majority shareholder, subsidized the airfare entirely, telling Beeli the shipment would fly “free of charge.”He brazenly posted on LinkedIn:For the next two shipments, the organization was forced to use a different airline in light of Hainan’s decision to pause Wuhan-bound flights in response to the virus. They opted for majority-CCP-owned Air China, which similarly subsidized the flight after receiving directives from the Chinese Embassy in Switzerland.According to Beeli: “To apply for urgent delivery service (free) from Air China we needed a document from the Chinese Embassy in Switzerland. I contacted Miss Li Ling, head of the consular section of the Embassy, ​​and within a matter of minutes I got the document.”He gloated on LinkedIn: The third and last shipment included seven oxygen concentrators. Beeli posted on LinkedIn:While Beeli states his organization “may try to import masks from China to Switzerland” if “the situation gets more severe,” at the time of writing, no effort has been initiated.And “severe” is an understatement of the current medical supplies scarcity plaguing Europe: the World Health Organization described the continent as facing “critical shortages.”",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/china-poached-swiss-supplies/
102,Politics,"Make No Mistake, ‘President Cuomo’ Would Be More Radical Than Biden","The Democratic Party has a serious problem right now: Joe Biden is the presumptive nominee.It took Biden six days to respond to the coronavirus emergency, and subsequent appearances have been nothing short of rambling and incoherent.As a private citizen, Biden has no official role to play in our current crisis, while his opponent President Trump is front and center. These factors have caused Democratic strategists to wonder if there might be an alternative.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been drawing a favorable contrast to the hapless Biden.Like Trump, Cuomo has been in front of the cameras as he leads his state’s response to the pandemic.Unlike Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, Cuomo has parked his partisanship – at least momentarily – cooperating with the Trump administration.A savvy operator from a political family, Cuomo understands the benefit of putting politics to one side. While he has ruled out running in the 2020 primary (and has already endorsed Biden), that has not stopped pundits fantasizing a dark horse campaign.Biden may hold an impressive delegate lead, but hasn’t yet wrapped up the nomination.It remains possible that he arrives at the convention with less than a full majority, meaning Democratic delegates (including the infamous superdelegates) will have the option of picking someone besides ‘Sleepy Joe’.The last time there was a brokered Democratic convention was in 1968, when Democratic insiders picked Hubert Humphrey.Young leftists rioted throughout Chicago that summer, and Humphrey went on to lose to Richard Nixon anyway.Spurning Biden, however, is unlikely to provoke many riots.Forty-three percent of likely Democratic voters are willing to support someone else in November, according to a recent poll.For now, Joe Biden is the devil they know: a high-profile Senator for many years, and Vice President under Barack Obama.On the other hand, this pandemic might be many voters’ first exposure to Governor Cuomo.Centrists and Republicans hesitant about voting for President Trump might think that Cuomo could be the moderate Democratic statesman they are looking for. Don’t be fooled though. Andrew Cuomo represents the worst of leftist authoritarianism, and a Cuomo White House would be a disaster for America.As Governor of New York, Cuomo has taken positions at the extreme left of American political discourse.He has used his position to hinder enforcement of immigration law.In 2018, Cuomo pardoned seven illegal aliens facing deportation. Last summer he signed a law allowing illegals to apply for drivers’ licenses while also blocking the ability of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to use New York Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) data to determine immigration status.All the Democrats who competed in this year’s presidential primary have already promised free healthcare for illegal aliens. A potential President Cuomo would completely erase the distinction between legal and illegal immigrant.Despite claiming to be a proud Catholic, Cuomo signed into law one of the most radical pro-abortion laws in the nation, not only legalizing late-term abortion but also removing a requirement that only licensed physicians perform the practice.Cuomo would undoubtedly return to the Obama tradition of appointing only the most extreme progressive judges to the Supreme Court, severely setting back the pro-life cause.Finally, Andrew Cuomo has declared all-out war on the Second Amendment in New York.He has used tragedies like the Sandy Hook shooting to justify so-called “assault weapons” bans as well as red flag laws that allow police to confiscate firearms without due process. Cuomo took this war a step further in the past year, leaning on payment processors to cease doing business with the NRA and other gun rights organizations.As a Democrat in a blue state, Cuomo has not faced a serious political challenge in many years.Even though New York state is full of rural red Republican counties once you get outside the Big Apple, Cuomo seems to believe that conservatives don’t matter anymore.“…[T]he extreme conservatives, they have no place in the state of New York, because that’s not who New Yorkers are,” he said during his 2014 reelection campaign. Imagine this eliminationist rhetoric in Washington, D.C.President Cuomo would surely say to the hundred million Americans who are pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, pro-traditional marriage, and believe in a real national border that they are not welcome in America, because that’s “not who we are”.Make no mistake: Andrew Cuomo is not a moderate, not a statesman, and not what America needs, especially now.As bad as Biden in high office would be, Cuomo would be much worse.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/cuomo-worse-than-biden/
103,Politics,"Soros Org’s Virus Playbook: ‘Abolish The Family, Free Prisoners, And Take Properties Without Permission’","Abolish the family, free all prisoners, and take vacant properties without permission is the preferred response to the coronavirus according to openDemocracy – a media organization funded by billionaire social justice financier George Soros.The group published an article last week, the main thrust of which asserts: “In short, the pandemic is no time to forget about family abolition.”Author and radical marxist Sophie Lewis further states: “We deserve better than the family. And the time of corona is an excellent time to practice abolishing it.”Staying home with family to practice social distancing in an effort to stop the spread coronavirus represents “the mystification of the couple-form; the romanticization of kinship; and the sanitization of the fundamentally unsafe space that is private property.”The assault on the family continues: “How can a zone defined by the power asymmetries of housework (reproductive labor being so gendered), of renting and mortgage debt, land and deed ownership, of patriarchal parenting and (often) the institution of marriage, benefit health?”It also focuses on how “queer and feminized people, especially very old and very young ones, are definitionally not safe [at home]” despite providing no source to corroborate the absurd allegation.And the “pitfalls” of normal family structure predate coronavirus:“…even when the private nuclear household poses no direct physical or mental threat to one’s person – no spouse-battering, no child rape, and no queer-bashing – the private family qua mode of social reproduction still, frankly, sucks. It genders, nationalizes and races us. It norms us for productive work. It makes us believe we are ‘individuals.’ It minimizes costs for capital while maximizing human beings’ life-making labor (across billions of tiny boxes, each kitted out – absurdly – with its own kitchen, micro-crèche and laundry).”OpenDemocracy goes further than just bashing the American family.It glorifies people confiscating private property as a means to “beat back gentrification” and demonstrate how “comfortable housing” is a “basic human birthright”.“Meanwhile, by taking vacant properties without permission, and living in them (“self-quarantine in progress,” reads one mom’s window-sign), Moms 4 Housing is leading the way in beating back gentrification in California and enacting an understanding of comfortable housing as a basic human birthright.”Even Los Angeles’s efforts to “provide individual trailers and pop-up isolation cabins for the houseless” are apparently not enough.Instead, Lewis advocates “a far more logical response might be: open all the hotels and private palaces on the basis of airy and light-filled, sanitary (uncommodified) housing for all.”Another component of this radical plan?To “free all prisoners and detainees now, remake the care facilities as spacious self-led villages, and dismiss all the workers with full pay so they can leave their bunks forever, move in with their friends, and pursue laziness for at least the next decade.”The piece leaves readers with the thought: “We do not know yet if we will be able to wrench something better than capitalism from the wreckage of this Plague and the coming Depression” – yet the organization wagers “with some certainty that, in 2020, the dialectic of families against the family, of real homes against the home, shall intensify.”Even in times of crisis, the left’s radical quest for social justice doesn’t stop; it intensifies. Proving once again, there’s no rest for the wicked.Soros’s Open Society Foundation contributed four sizable donations to the “global media organization” in 2017: three were in the $100,000 – $120,000 range and one was an unspecified amount above $120,000.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/soros-corona-abolish-family/
104,Politics,NeverTrumpers Use Coronavirus to Urge MORE Globalism… They’re Dangerously Wrong.,"It’s past time to take a close look at our reliance on China, a country that routinely covers up real threats to its people and the whole world.U.S. intelligence believes “China has concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its country,” now should mark a change in our approach to Sino-American relations, according to a recent Bloomberg News report.And while some are using the crisis to push globalization, they fail to realize (or choose to ignore) that our dangerous reliance on foreign countries has been exposed.In an article titled “Economic Nationalism will make COVID worse,” NeverTrumper Bill Kristol and his The Bulwark website push the narrative that the crisis showcases the need for more global cooperation and a free flow of goods and services.They claim: “it would be deeply irresponsible to exploit this crisis to push for a dramatic shift in medical supply policy,” and that doing so would make it harder to treat the virus.The Bulwark article also downplays China’s disastrous coverup and asserts: “now is not the time to antagonize Beijing.”This, about a Communist regime that lied about the coronavirus from the very beginning, when transparency could have saved thousands of lives, millions of jobs, and trillions of dollars.Their deference to China makes even Bernie Sanders look hawkish.Spain purchased test kits from a Chinese company. They only correctly identified 30 percent of virus cases. In the Netherlands, a 600,000 face masks recall due to the low quality of the China-made products. With over 110,000 cases and more than 13,000 deaths, Italy is experiencing severe shortages of essential medical supplies and equipment.Why should the United States – the world’s only superpower – follow these trends?A study by the Department of Commerce revealed 97 percent of antibiotics in the United States come from China and 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to produce drugs.A 2019 report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission notes: “China is the world’s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The United States is heavily dependent on drugs that are either sourced from China or include APIs sourced from China. This is especially true for generic drugs, which comprise most prescriptions filled in the United States. Drug companies are not required to list the API country of origin on their product labels; therefore, U.S. consumers may be unknowingly accepting risks associated with drugs originating from China.”“The way this could spill over is simple and terrifying,” explains David Dayen.“For decades, world leaders have allowed multinationals to chase lower labor costs, thereby centralizing production and fixing supply lines. We’re now seeing the tragic fragility associated with that decision. Chinese disruptions don’t just hit Chinese manufacturing, they hit everyone’s.”In addition to leaving us more vulnerable at times like these, our China deference has also left our nation poorer in peacetime.Between 2001 and 2018 the U.S. lost 3.7 million jobs due to the growth of the U.S. trade deficit with China according to a report by the Economic Policy Institute. Surging imports of steel, aluminum, and other products from China threaten hundreds of thousands more American jobs.So how do we bring millions of jobs back to the United States, secure ourselves from foreign threats, and create a self-sufficient medical supply while keeping drug and medical supply prices reasonable for the average American consumer?Steps are already being taken to increase domestic production with President Donald Trump announcing an upcoming executive order which will insist on American-made medical supplies and pharmaceuticals.Senator Tom Cotton and Congressman Mike Gallagher have introduced a bill which would require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to create a registry of all drugs and corresponding APIs that are produced outside the United States, require that all federally qualified health facilities purchase pharmaceutical products that have no APIs produced in China, have all drug companies list the APIs and their countries of origin on the labels of imported and domestically produced finished drug products, and provide incentives for manufacturing in America.To address the costs of moving away from China, the Trump administration and Congress should consider giving grants to pharmaceutical companies willing to commit to building domestic production facilities. They should also give tax breaks to manufacturers and new medical buildings and equipment should be singled out for further reductions.This would help lower the overall startup cost of drug manufacturing, enable the private sector to expand, stabilize the U.S. economy, and would be a major investment in our long-term capacity and self-reliance from China and other countries.Some analysts are advocating for adjacent territories and nations such as Puerto Rico and Mexico to be incentivized and given the task of becoming the central location for U.S. drug manufacturing. This would allow us to invest economically in these countries which in the long term would help us to lessen our reliance on just China for pharmaceutical and medical supplies.Mexico has enormous growth potential and its location makes it an attractive investment destination. Although it brings with it risks in the form of corruption and organized crime, it could also help secure our southern border as Mexico advances economically and gives its citizens better-living conditions, and therefore less reason to cross illegally into the United States.At any rate, as we look at the global pandemic happening it should awaken us to our dangerous reliance on other countries, and we have been afforded an opportunity to change this that we must take.It is long past time to develop a plan to end China’s dominance of critical pharmaceutical supplies, their leverage over our economy, bring back domestic manufacturing, and with it our jobs and our security.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/nevertrumpers-coronavirus-globalism/
105,Politics,Donald Trump: War Time President.,"In February, former Donald Trump 2016 communications advisor Jason Miller declared the commander in chief “a wartime President”.Only a limited number have held this moniker.Of the prior 44 presidents, 13 have been considered “wartime presidents,” from Madison to Bush.What we’re living through today isn’t a traditional war. This is a much different war. Not a war in the sense of carrier ships, Apache helicopters, ordinance, and bloodshed. But rather a war against an “invisible enemy,” – a pandemic.While the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus invades the United States, President Trump echoed Miller’s sentiment last week, referring to himself as, “in a sense a wartime President.”Since the virus landed on U.S. soil, there have been nearly 200,000 cases and approaching 4000 deaths. That’s more than the number of people who died on 9/11.With the numbers growing every hour, the President and indeed Congress are taking wartime measures.President Trump recently invoked the National Defense Act, first used during the Korean War to allow get businesses to ramp up much needed supplies.The Act will today be used to fight the virus by demanding the mass production of masks, gloves, gowns, hand sanitizer, and ventilators.The Trump administration has also ordered the deployment of Naval hospital ships, the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy to arrive on both coasts in an attempt to alleviate the number of non-viral medical needs.While Democrats and the media have criticized the administration, the American people appear to see it otherwise, with the President garnering a 55 percent approval rating for his response to the CCP virus. This number surged up from 43 percent approval just one week before the harsher measures.The McLaughlin Group recently confirmed such numbers:The majority of American voters approve of the job the president is doing handling the coronavirus situation, 53% approve and 45% disapprove. In the battleground states, 55% approve and 43% disapprove of the president’s handling of the coronavirus emergency. Besides Republicans giving the president near unanimous approval 88%-11%, Independents approve 47%-48% and 25% of the Democrats approve. Among the traditionally Democratic leaning voter groups, Hispanic voters, 44%, approve and among African American voters, 34%, approve.Democrats also received another blow when Trump’s work in combating the pandemic received praise from some unlikely sources in Governor Newsom (D-CA) and Governor Cuomo (D-NY).Governor Newsom recently credited Trump for his efforts: “He said everything I could have hoped for”, the Governor said. “And we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, he followed through on.”New York Governor Cuomo echoed those statements, “His team is on it. They’ve been responsive.” He then added, “I want to say thank you.”Meanwhile, Speaker Pelosi is predictably attempting to politicize the event, and favored Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is hunkered down in his home, producing a lackluster podcast entitled “Here’s the Deal.”“His denial at the beginning was deadly,” Pelosi remarked this weekend of President Trump.“[Trump’s] delaying of getting equipment… to where it is needed is deadly,” she added.She was quickly put on blast by Senator Lindsey Graham, who told Fox News: “That’s the most shameful, disgusting statement by any politician in modern history.”Graham was right.Democrats ate into much of the capacity of the White House and U.S. government through the end of 2019 and into the beginning of 2020 by promoting the partisan impeachment process.“[The coronavirus] came up while we were tied down in the impeachment trial,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday. “And I think it diverted the attention of the government, because everything, every day was all about impeachment.”It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus….— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020Meanwhile, the media has been more concerned with whatever sobriquet the President has been using to describe the CCP virus. Recently, he dubbed it the “Chinese virus” while stressing over Twitter: “It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!”It is increasingly looking like President Trump’s handling of the CCP virus will define his Presidency – or at least the first term.Impeachment feels like it was a decade ago, and Americans are increasingly looking to shed partisanship, and embrace a united approach to something far more instinctive than politics: survival.If President Donald Trump can maintain his war time footing, his decisive action, and stay above the partisan fray, he will emerge as one of the most successful war time presidents the country has seen in a long time.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/donald-trump-war-time-president/
106,Politics,Another Chinese Company Poached Over 90 TONS Of Vital Medical Equipment,"Country Garden Holdings, one of China’s largest property developers, siphoned over 90 tons of vital medical supplies from Australia at the onset of the novel Coronavirus pandemic.It certainly goes against the Chinese Communist Party’s narrative its spearheading “global cooperation” in light of the virus outbreak its coverup helped spawn.And this is the second Chinese-owned company that exploited Australia for its stockpile of essential supplies including masks, protective suits, gloves, and more.Earlier this week, it was discovered Chinese Communist Party affiliated developer Greenland Group participated in a similar scheme. A whistleblower revealed employees were tasked with “sourcing bulk supplies of surgical masks, thermometers, antibacterial wipes, hand sanitisers, gloves and Panadol for shipping.”And their efforts were immensely successful, albeit at the expense of Australian healthcare workers and citizens:” the group sourced 3 million protective masks, 700,000 hazmat suits and 500,000 pairs of protective gloves from Australia, Canada, Turkey and other countries,” according to a company newsletter.And Country Garden Holdings, reffered to as “Risland” in Australia, acted no differently.According to a brazen LinkedIn post form the company, “the chartered plane with 90 tons of medical supplies, including 100,000 most needed protective coveralls and 900,000 pairs of medical gloves, has successfully departed from Sydney and arrived in Wuhan on 24 Feb.” Other posts reiterated the same message, gloating about the extensive amount of medical supplies they were able to source: “90 tons of selective medical supplies… ready for the air transport direct from Sydney to Wuhan via corporate jet on Monday next week.” Adding, it was “an exceptional and meaningful day” for the company’s “campaign to show our strong faiths to Wuhan people and our ultimate appreciation to those who work days and nights and fight against the virus at the front line.”The company’s CEO, general manager, and human resources and administration manager had the nerve to hold a banner proclaiming “China-Australia work as one together to fight epidemic.” Now, Australia is experiencing a heavy shortage of the exact supplies poached by these Chinese companies. Similar scarcities are plaguing Europe as well.Such life-threatening supply chain difficulties are also inextricably linked to the West’s crippling dependence on Chinese manufacturing, now derailed by the virus. Coronavirus is just the latest phenomenon to debunk the global establishment’s outsourcing-ridden economic doctrine.And the products continuing to be exported from China are also crippling the world’s response to the virus. Governments and medical professionals in Spain and the Czech Republic lost crucial response time after they were shipped Coronavirus test kits from China that only provided accurate results 30 percent of the time.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/china-siphons-australia-supplies/
107,Politics,#NeverNikki: Gov. Haley Should NOT Be the GOP Choice in 2024,"The Republican establishment still doesn’t get it.Donald Trump defeated more than a dozen mainstream Republicans in the 2016 presidential primary with a message of America First. He called out the Iraq War, promised to bring troops home from the Middle East, criticized the outsourcing of American jobs to foreign workers, and vowed to return power to the American people. The establishment, which has always been content to move leftward on social issues, has refused to budge on more war, free trade, increased immigration, and corporate bailouts. Their latest hope in returning to their glory days of the Bush era is in former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.Born in South Carolina to immigrants from India, Haley was a businesswoman before she was a politician. She served in the South Carolina House of Representatives for six years prior to winning the governorship in 2010. During the 2016 campaign, Haley took a strong stand against then-candidate Trump, initially backing Senator Marco Rubio. “Reject the siren call of the angriest voices,” she told Republican voters. Despite her initial rejection of the America First mentality, she supported President Trump in the general election, and he returned the favor, appointing her Ambassador to the United Nations.Having failed to thwart President Trump’s electoral victory, many in the Republican establishment feigned tepid support for the him with an eye toward infiltrating his administration to push for their preferred positions. They also set their sights on 2024: Nikki Haley was the chosen one.In a media environment that sees the left fully embracing identity politics, many on the right foolishly believe they can counter this by promoting their own female or minority champions. Haley fits the bill, being a woman of Indian ethnicity. But the eagerness of the NeverTrump caucus for a Haley campaign stems more from a desire to return to the failed Republican policies of the past. “Nikki Haley… is basically my spirit animal,” said conservative commentator and longtime President Trump critic Ben Shapiro.For several years now, rumors based on “anonymous sources” have been circulating, suggesting President Trump would replace Vice President Mike Pence on the 2020 ticket with Nikki Haley. Such a move would set her up for a 2024 run whether President Trump wins or loses. Ben Shapiro’s Daily Wire website amplified such rumors as far back as 2018, insisting “perhaps it may be time for Pence to consider his retirement.”To her credit, Haley herself emphatically denied the confected scuttlebutt, but to this day they continue to circulate. Is establishment “conservative” media reporting the news, or trying to create it? More than 60 million Americans voted for President Trump precisely because he represented a break with the Republican policies of the past. Commentators such as Shapiro seem willfully blind to this new reality and party. Nikki Haley’s positions are at odds with the desires of right-leaning American voters, as expressed in their 2016 vote. While President Trump campaigned on peace with Russia, Haley has said: “We don’t trust Russia; we don’t trust Putin; we never will. They’re never going to be our friend. That’s just a fact.” In April of 2018, Haley drew the ire of the president when she preemptively announced new sanctions against Russia before President Trump had officially authorized them.While candidate Trump campaigned on border enforcement, stronger restrictions on legal immigration, and a refugee moratorium, Haley champions corporate-backed pushes for more immigration: “No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.” She’s also a purveyor of the left’s foolish “nation of immigrants” platitude; in fact, she’s “proud of it.”While President Trump has used tariffs to protect American manufacturing and even the playing field with subversive foreign nations, Haley is a free trade stalwart. While President Trump has asked American companies to “hire American and buy American,” Haley has supported removing barriers to outsourcing. When thousands of Americans were losing their jobs so companies could hire foreigners at lower wages, she wanted to broaden H1B visa programs for Indian tech workers: “There’s a lot of talent in India and that talent when they come here and they get educated here, it’s the first talent we want to see be able to join our forces and work for our companies.”However, Haley gained a reputation for being friendly to businesses during her time as governor. When Boeing faced mounting expenses at their Washington state manufacturing plant due to union agitation and state regulations, Haley offered incentives for them to bring construction of the new 787 Dreamliner aircraft to South Carolina.After stepping down from the Trump Administration in 2018, she quickly found a home on Boeing’s board of directors. Recently, she resigned, saying she disagreed with Boeing’s push for a bailout in the wake of the coronavirus stock market crash. While commendable, she did not seem to have a problem with Boeing’s recent outsourcing of manufacturing that drew sharp attention after the company endured several high-profile aircraft failures.In short, Nikki Haley is another establishment Republican in the mold of Jeb Bush, whom voters soundly rejected in 2016. America is hungry for an alternative to the same old politics of foreign wars, free trade, and open borders.Young people are increasingly turning to socialism, and the only way to counter that is by offering a message that puts America and American workers first, not the war industry or the cheap foreign worker lobbies. As much as establishment conservatives salivate over a Nikki Haley campaign, she would prove disastrous for the Republican Party and for America.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/nikki-haley-not-for-2024/

The province has been on a complete lockdown – not allowing any traffic in or out – since March 19th due to the death toll of the novel coronavirus felt especially hard across Italy.According to reports, a 44 year old Pakistani national who was “known to the police and involved in drug trafficking” stumbled upon Maggiacomo’s farm while attempting to leave the city despite the lockdown. Maggiacomo informed the man it wouldn’t be possible to leave the city and nor should he.But no good deed goes unpunished.In response, the man became aggressive, hurling “insults,” prompting Maggiacomo to call his son asking him to alert the police. When police finally showed up, he was found dead, clenching the foreigner’s health card.

Then bragged about it.Despite President Trump’s America First ideology, the bureaucrats at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) said on March 17th:Today, the United States through its Agency for International Development (USAID) handed over personal protective equipment (PPE) to the City Center for Ambulance Services in Nur-Sultan.  This equipment is part of the United States government’s early assistance to Kazakhstan to prepare for the potential spread of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19.  In addition to the PPE, USAID has also allocated additional funding to support Kazakhstan’s response to COVID-19.The PPE provided by USAID includes 10,000 examination gloves, 10,000 masks, 1,400 isolation gowns, and 200 protective goggles. This equipment will subsequently be distributed to healthcare workers in regional centers and cities across Kazakhstan. It will protect and enable health workers in Kazakhstan to respond quickly and safely to treat COVID-19 patients. The donated PPE is vital to reduce the infection risk facing frontline health workers.“Today, an infectious-disease threat anywhere in the world can easily cross borders and create health hazards across the globe, that is why cooperation on the international level and mutual support are crucial in such critical times,” said U.S. Ambassador to Kazakhstan, William Moser.Amb. Moser is a career diplomat, and not a Trump political appointee.“We are proud to support the Government of Kazakhstan’s efforts by providing personal protective equipment and Emergency Reserve Fund financing to stop the spread of COVID-19 to ensure people are safe and healthy,” Moser added.Meanwhile, hospitals across the United States and in allied nations are begging for PPE.“Physicians and the rest of the health care team cannot be thrown into battle poorly equipped. We cannot safely test, examine, or treat our patients without protective masks, gowns, gloves, and other equipment,” David Fleeger, the president of the Texas Medical Association, said in a written statement published by the Texas Tribune.Meanwhile in New Hampshire: “We want to collect what we can and make sure the whole health care and first responder community of Portsmouth is going to get what they need,” said Fire Chief Todd Germain, during a PPE donation drive.Earlier this week the Food and Drug Administration announced there was a need to engage “with importers and others involved in the import trade community during this pandemic to facilitate the entry of needed products, including PPE, into the U.S.”On March 26th – just over one week after the U.S. transfer – the government of Kazakhstan began handing out 5 masks per person to the general public.Their website states, via Google Translate:The Youth Policy Directorate of the #Birgemiz movement held a social campaign to distribute medical masks… Volunteers distributed the necessary means of protection against various viruses to residents of the capital for free – 5 pieces per person.The free masks are said to be made domestically in Kazakhstan:In total, 30,000 medical masks will be distributed to residents of the capital… they can be obtained at retail stores, as well as in shopping centers and various supermarkets.With the desperate need for equipment across U.S. hospitals, and a price premium to boot, members of the public will surely be asking why USAID is sending so many abroad.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/ppe-usaid-masks-kazakhstan/
110,Politics,"Leaked Hospital Group Letter Reveals Patient ‘Eligibility’ Guidelines for Ventilators, Ex-Obamacare Chief Lies About Current Use","A draft letter outlining how “[p]atients who have the best chance of getting better” will be prioritized for ventilators or Intensive Care Unit beds while others will be given painkillers is said to have leaked from the Henry Ford Health System in Michigan. The network of six hospitals first established in 1915 appeared to confirm the report which also appeared on NPR’s local Michigan radio website early Friday morning, though they say the policy is not currently in use.“Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority,” the letter says.“Patients will be evaluated for the best plan for care, and dying patients will be provided comfort care.”Conditions that could affect whether a patient is eligible for critical care are: “severe heart, lung, kidney or liver failure; terminal cancer; or severe trauma or burns.”Dr. Adnan Munkarah, EVP & Chief Clinical Officer for Henry Ford Health Systems said on Friday morning:“With a pandemic of this nature, health systems must be prepared for a worst case scenario. Gathering the collective wisdom from across our industry, we carefully crafted our policy to provide critical guidance to healthcare workers for making difficult patient care decisions during an unprecedented emergency. These guidelines are deeply patient focused, intended to be honoring to patients and families. We were pleased to share our policy with our colleagues across Michigan to help others develop similar, compassionate approaches. It is our hope we never have to apply them and we will always do everything we can to care for our patients, utilizing every resource we have to make that happen.”A spokesman for Henry Ford Health told Michigan Radio NPR the letter represents a “worst case scenario” situation but is not active policy at this point.Andrew Slavitt, former Affordable Care Act head for President Obama, tweeted that a “major hospital in the Midwest has reached its limits on ventilators minutes ago”.He refused to give the name of the hospital, or cite a source for his apparently erroneous claim.UPDATE: Slavitt removed his tweet hours later, claiming: “I removed a tweet because it enflamed a left-right contraversy about how bad the crisis is becoming in major hospitals running low or out of capacity. While I want to inform with the best knowledge I have, I won’t do that at the expense of that kind of discord right now.”NOW: A major hospital in the Midwest has reached its limit on ventilators minutes ago.They are handing out forms saying that only those “with the best chance of survival” will get care. Others will be getting pain medication. 1/— Andy Slavitt @ 🏡 (@ASlavitt) March 27, 2020The National Pulse reached out to the Henry Ford Health System for clarification on whether the policy is being implemented yet, per Slavitt’s assertion, and at the time of publication there had been no reply, though their Twitter account replied to one user: “…this policy was developed should we need to implement it. We have not needed it at this time.”Hi @GumboJesus, this policy was developed should we need to implement it. We have not needed it at this time.— Henry Ford News (@HenryFordNews) March 27, 2020On Wednesday March 25th, Henry Ford said its facilities in Detroit (877 beds) and West Bloomfield (191 beds) were “quite full,” with over 400 confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases across their system.“We feel like we’re on the front end of the surge,” said Dr. Betty Chu, Henry Ford’s associate chief clinical officer and chief quality officer.“But we’re anticipating a significant increase in volume in the coming weeks…We feel like we’re on the rapid acceleration of a growth curve.”In that same report, Henry Ford’s chief operating officer Bob Riney pointed to expanding capacity, rather than restricting patient access to required treatment.“Our plan is to use all the capacity in our existing facilities first… And then, what we would hit – where we no longer had the ability to safely take care of patients – is those facilities would go to all of the additional capacity expansion [plans already being put into place, like converting surgical rooms into COVID units and doubling the bed counts in some ICUs.]”On Thursday, however, the tone changed.Michigan Radio’s Doug Tribou discussed the matters with two doctors from the Henry Ford Health System, Dr. Rana Awdish and Dr. Megan Bonanni.“One scenario is rationing ventilators and making life-or-death choices about who gets them,” Tribou reported.“There’s a recognition that these decisions can’t be improvised,” Dr. Awdish said.She added: “So groups of people are coming together – clinical ethicists, palliative care physicians, ER physicians, ICU physicians,  administrators – to write guidelines. The New England Journal of Medicine published theirs for allocation. And it’s really coming from an understanding that individual physicians should not be left alone to make decisions in a resource-constrained environment, that there has to be guidance.”",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/leaked-hospital-letter-eligibility-ventilators/
111,Politics,China Scams With Faulty Coronavirus Test Kits,"The novel Coronavirus pandemic is sounding the death knell on the world’s crippling dependence on goods made in China.China’s lax environmental standards, slave labor, and communist ruling regime’s unfettered economic appetite, make it a fount for cheap products. But that’s a deadly double-edged sword, as the quality of the country’s exports is sacrificed in the name of maximizing margins.Look no further than Spain.Spain, the country trailing only Italy in Coronavirus deaths, ordered rapid test kits from Chinese company Bioeasy which failed to achieve their only purpose: detect the virus. In fact, the test failed to accurately detect Coronavirus-positive patients more than one-third of the time.According to Spanish microbiology expert led research, confirmed by the Spanish Health Ministry, the tests only provided accurate results in 30 percent of patients, well under the Center for Disease Control bare minimum of 80 percent sensitivity.Already reeling from another product made in China – the virus itself – the Spanish government is now forced to either assemble their own tests or source functional ones. And the inevitable deaths that will result from the delay are on the hands of Bioeasy, aided and abbeted by the Chinese Communist Party’s shoddy production standards.The Chinese Embassy responded predictably, blaming the Spanish government since they allegedly “gave Spain a list of manufacturers and that Bioeasy was not among them, adding that it had not been given a license from China’s National Medical Products Administration to sell its products.”Healthcare professionals in the Czech Republic are also experiencing similar, faulty results with test kits they ordered from China. It’s unknown whether or not they’re from the same company.And America is not immune from this threat.In accordance with the political establishment’s doctrine of managed decline, their decades-long crusade to outsource virtually all American manufacturing overseas, especially to China, is a Spanish-style disaster just waiting to happen. Even vital industries like prescription drugs are at the mercy of China: nearly “80 percent of the basic components used in U.S. drugs, known as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), come from China and India.”We’re betting global health on the standards of Chinese Communist Party, and the odds aren’t in our favor.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/spain-test-kits/
112,Politics,China Used Its Global Companies To Suck Other Countries Dry Of Medical Supplies,"Greenland Group, a Chinese Communist Party affiliated developer, intentionally poached vital medical supplies from nations across the globe at the onset of the novel Coronavirus pandemic.Originally founded as a state-owned enterprise, the development group is now publicly-traded, but the largest stake – nearly 50 percent– belongs to the Shanghai government. The remaining equity is apportioned primarily among CCP-linked individuals and investment firms. While the group focuses on expanding Chinese influence across four continents via real estate development, they abandoned business as usual in January when they sensed Coronavirus snowballing into a global pandemic.Employees were tasked with “sourcing bulk supplies of surgical masks, thermometers, antibacterial wipes, hand sanitisers, gloves and Panadol for shipping,” according to a company insider.The buying blitz was company-wide and exhaustive: ”Basically all employees, the majority of whom are Chinese, were asked to source whatever medical supplies they could. There were numerous requests from the HR manager and even our direct reporting line [which] prioritized the assisting of the company in gathering these supplies over other work activities.” The accounts department was “absent for days as they were out purchasing supplies,” the source added.The company even converted boardrooms and conference rooms in Greenland Australia’s headquarters to repack their newly-acquired medical items into boxes emblazoned with the company’s logo. Hefty pallet-loads of the supplies, seen below, were then sent to China.According to a company newsletter, the group sourced 3 million protective masks, 700,000 hazmat suits and 500,000 pairs of protective gloves from “Australia, Canada, Turkey and other countries.”Greenland Australia’s managing director Sherwood Luo documented the shipping effort on social media. He posted to popular Chinese social media network WeChat: “#CombatCoronavirus, Greenland Australia is Taking Action. The second batch of non-contact forehead thermometers will soon take off to China! Coronavirus situation is serious, Chinese people, local and overseas, are trying their best, fighting together to combat the virus.”In a statement to the Australian news outlet the Sydney Morning Herald, the Greenland Group admitted to buying the supplies, chalking it up to their intention to help prevent the spread of Coronavirus: “[Greenland] felt compelled … to assist in efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus, which had caused a shortage of crucial medical supplies in China.”Greenland Australia was an auxiliary force, “arranging for medical supplies to be dispatched to China, which at that time, was the epicenter of the outbreak.”Despite Greenland’s massive stockpile, other nations are experiencing life-threatening shortages of masks and protective gear. Some healthcare workers have even resorted to sewing their own masks. It’s a tale as old as time: while the rest of the world reels from CCP-induced harm, whether inflicted on the economy through currency manipulation and nonreciprocal trade policies or on global health by the regime’s inadequate response to Coronavirus, China always looks out for itself.Coronavirus should set a new precedent: the world is done being collateral damage of China’s economic exploitation.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/china-medical-supplies/
113,Politics,"Anti PornHub Petition Nears 600,000 Sigs Following Rape/Assault Scandal","PornHub, one of the most visited pornographic websites in the world, has come under fire for video content involving sexual abuse. The outrage follows a recent surge in films depicting trafficking, rape, and under-age sex. A petition demanding the removal of such content now has over 550,000 signatures, and accuses PornHub of both encouraging and monetizing abusive behavior. According to anti-trafficking activist Laila Mickelwait, “teen” is one of the most search categories on PornHub’s site, calling into question the legality of the site’s films. In an opinion piece for the Washington Examiner, Mickelwait writes: “…a quick search for the word “teen” turns up titles such as “Young Girl Tricked,” “Innocent Brace Faced Tiny Teen F—ed,” “Tiny Petite Thai Teen,” “Teen Little Girl First Time,” on and on ad infinitum.”Late last year, a mother was reunited with her missing 15-year-old daughter after discovering explicit photos of her online. Detectives discovered the girl had appeared in 58 rape and abuse videos, all featured on PornHub.Similarly, a group of women recently won a 12.7 million dollar lawsuit against “GirlsDoPorn” – a company owned by a man named Micheal Pratt. Pratt reportedly coerced the 22 women to perform sex acts on film, then uploaded the footage to PornHub. Pratt and his colleagues allegedly filmed child rape and sexual abuse, and trafficked a minor. In a statement, PornHub’s parent company, Mindgeek, said, “Pornhub has a steadfast commitment to eradicating and fighting non-consensual content and under-age material. Any suggestion otherwise is categorically and factually inaccurate.” The site itself generates revenue via advertisements associated with its videos.Posting around six million videos per year – some showing “extremely hardcore and violent pornography” – PornHub’s site is free to access and has no enforced age restrictions. In an interview, Mickelwait told Fox News PornHub is “set up for exploitation,” and communicated her plans to notify the Trump administration of the petition. In a shared effort, Senator Bill Sasse (R-NE) called on Attorney General William Barr to probe PornHub in a letter to the Department of Justice. Sasse wrote, “Pornhub’s incredible reach has a much darker side than the image of harmless fun that it tries to project.In several notable incidents over the past year, Pornhub made content available worldwide showing women and girls that were victims of trafficking being raped and exploited.” Sasse also pointed out that PayPal, an online money transfer service, now prohibits PornHub from using its sources to facilitate payments due to the recent controversy. The Department of Justice declined to comment on the letter.According to State Department reports, the United States ranks among the worst countries in the world for human trafficking, joining Mexico and the Philipines in the “top three nations of origin for victims of human trafficking.”Despite backlash and public outrage, PornHub executives instead announced an extension of free premium site access to countries impacted by the novel coronavirus – namely, France, Italy and Spain. With increasing numbers forced to stay inside and quarantine, PornHub sees another exploitation opportunity. When asked whether the offer would extend to the United States, a spokesman for PornHub said, “We are assessing the COVID-19 pandemic daily to determine how else we can support our vast global community, including expanding free access to Pornhub Premium.”",https://thenationalpulse.com/culture/pornhub-petition-nears-600k/
114,Politics,CAIN: Ghoulish Media Wish Trump Would Catch the Coronavirus,"Trump haters have lost their minds… if they had any minds left to lose.Ever since the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, President Donald Trump’s critics have been frothing at the mouth over the prospect that he could have caught the virus after coming into contact with an infected individual.This has been the essence of the left since before President Trump was elected. Instead of disagreeing with his political viewpoints, they wish misfortune on him and his followers.This ugly instinct surfaced again recently when it was found that a member of Brazilian Prime Minister Jair Bolsonaro’s team had tested positive for the virus after dining with President Trump in Florida.The Brazilian prime minister took a test that came back negative, but that didn’t stop a rumor from circulating in the meantime that he had tested positive for the virus and potentially exposed President Trump to it as well.BREAKING Late last night, with tears in his eyes and appearing pale, Pres. #JairBolsonaro of Brazil announced he tested + for #COVID19 — which, it is assumed, he and at least one member of his staff acquired while visiting @realDonaldTrump at Mar-a-Lago. https://t.co/WyGzSgi7N9— Laurie Garrett (@Laurie_Garrett) March 13, 2020Delighted leftists – including from the Council on Foreign Relations – continued to hold out morbid hope that the President had nonetheless been infected even after Bolsonaro insisted on his personal Facebook page that he had tested negative for the virus.Wishing coronavirus on Republicans and Trump supporters seems to be a recurring theme.A Democratic City Councilwoman in Denver urged anybody who tests positive for coronavirus to attend as many Trump rallies as possible.In another instance, a woman who was stuck in her room on the Grand Princess cruise ship during a coronavirus outbreak tweeted that the cruise ship had run out of food. After seeing from an old tweet that she supported President Trump, angry leftists gloated at her predicament and remarked that she deserved to die on that ship because of her political views.Of course, the media piled on, hectoring President Trump about getting tested, even though he had no symptoms and was trying to set a good example for the American people by abstaining from testing that his doctors deemed unnecessary.As more media reports appeared on various coronavirus-positive people the President may have come into contact with during the Florida dinner or at Mar-a-Lago, his critics switched their tone from hopeful he catches the virus to angry he didn’t immediately test and self-quarantine.During a recent Rose Garden coronavirus press conference, multiple reporters urged President Trump to get tested for the virus, to which he responded he had no symptoms, but planned to get tested anyway.As usual, they presented him with a “heads I win, tails you lose” proposition.They would undoubtedly have called him a selfish hypocrite and a bad role model if he got tested without meeting the criteria laid out by his own administration for other Americans to follow.Even after the test and its negative result, some critics refused to believe him.Shouldn't the Times headline ""Trump Tests Negative"" read ""Trump Claims He's Negative""?— Gary Shteyngart (@Shteyngart) March 15, 2020Leftist hack George Conway — a lawyer, it should be noted — insulted the entire osteopathic medicine profession in an attempt to discredit the White House physician.So the White House physician isn’t an M.D.  Good Lord.  Someone sneeze on me now and just get it over with. https://t.co/owiJn0Iv1t pic.twitter.com/647BUJ25H4— George Conway (@gtconway3d) March 14, 2020Now the President has officially tested negative, as everyone should have expected based on the absence of symptoms, there’s no evident sense of relief on the left.Rather, liberals seem to be holding out hope that even though Trump hasn’t contracted coronavirus, his hands-on leadership style will expose him to the virus eventually.Fortunately, our President is a well-known germaphobe who has been following the CDC’s recommended procedures for preventing contagion long before the novel coronavirus ever emerged from Wuhan, China.Once again, liberals are merely indulging in wishful thinking.It’s difficult to believe that partisanship has escalated to such a point that people are actually hoping the President of the United States contracts a potentially dangerous virus — but it’s even more difficult to believe that liberals can’t seem to realize how petty and vindictive they sound when they do so.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/media-wish-president-trump-coronavirus/
115,Politics,NY-Based Muslim Brotherhood Activist Tells Followers To Target U.S. Embassies With Coronavirus,"A New York based Muslim Brotherhood activist encouraged his followers who exhibited symptoms of the novel coronavirus – touted by the group as its ‘machine gun’ and ‘F-16 fighter jet’ – to infect government officials at consulates and embassies.It’s the Muslim Brotherhood’s latest effort to “topple” Egypt’s current president, Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, who replaced Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party (FJP).The Sunni Islamist group operates in over 70 countries and boasts more than two million followers, propping up Sharia-compliant, fundamentalist regimes and often resorting to terrorist tactics to achieve their goals.Look no further than its founder, Hasan al-Banna’s description of the group’s extensive reach: “I did not want it to be confined to one group of Muslims or one aspect of Islamic reform; rather I sought that it be a general message based on learning, education, and jihad.” Adding, “It is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated, to impose its law on all nations and to extend its power to the entire planet.”And President Trump is cognizant of the threat; he rightfully pushed to designate the group as a terrorist organization in early 2019.And given New York based Muslim Brotherhood activist Bahgat Saber’s words, it’s not hard to see why.He encouraged his over 70 thousand followers to treat the virus as a bioweapon equivalent to machine guns and F-16 fighter jets: “When you talk to people, they say to you: ‘We don’t have machine guns, we don’t have F-16 planes, we don’t have this and that…’ But now you have the coronavirus culture.”To do so, Saber begs his viewers exhibiting “flu-like symptoms – cold, fever, sneezing” to “pay a visit to his ‘friends’ who work for Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi’s government.”He places a target on Egyptian consulates and embassies: “People who are outside of Egypt should go to any consulate or embassy. They are all licentious villains and sons of b*tches.”Saber heeds his own advice, threatening the Egyptian consulate in New York: “If I am infected, I will go to the Egyptian consulate here. They are all corrupt sons of bitches. I’ve been dealing with them for years.”And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, bringing the politicization of coronavirus to a whole new level.He continues, imploring his followers to “make proper use” of the Coronavirus to “exact revenge”: “If you have contracted coronavirus, you should exact revenge! Avenge yourself, avenge the honor of your women, avenge the people who are in prison, and avenge the oppressed people. Go there. Why die alone? When you die, why die alone? Perhaps coronavirus will topple Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi. Our Lord is capable of doing anything. But you have to make proper use of this.”And if entering government facilities proves to be difficult, Saber instructs viewers to “just wait for them and sneeze on their cars when they pass by.”He even implores his supporters to target the military, courts, and celebrities in Egypt: “If you want the state to care about coronavirus and start dealing with this disease, whoever among you suffers from influenza, fever, or cold, should just casually walk into a police station, or go to an office of the public prosecution, or to a courthouse. If you are a soldier, you can go into the defense ministry, and shake hands with all the generals of the military and the police. The same is true with the justice system. [People should target] the businessmen and actors who support Sisi. He should go to Media Production City. If there are people who oppose the military coup and work in Media Production City, and who have contracted anything – cold, fever, anything… They should go there and shake hands with everybody.”Emphasizing once again: “Exact revenge! This is legal and constitutional revenge. No law or constitution prohibits you from paying them a visit. If you know someone [sick], send him on a visit. You’ll be doing him a favor.”It certainly adheres to the group’s motto – “God is our goal, the Quran is our Constitution, the Prophet is our leader, struggle [jihad] is our way, and death in the service of God is the loftiest of our wishes. God is great. God is great” – and demonstrates convincingly why the group’s “terrorist” label is not far-fetched.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/muslim-brotherhood-activist/

117,Politics,"Political Correctness Kills: Fearing ‘Racism’ Allegations, Italy Failed to Isolate Wuhan Travelers Early","The former President of the European and Italian Society for Virology attributed Italy’s unmatched surge in novel Coronavirus deaths – even allegedly surpassing China – to the government’s fear of being labeled “racist” for barring Chinese entry.Dr. Giorgio Palù, also a Professor of Virology and Microbiology at the University of Padova, expressed concern over the Italian government’s inadequate response to the virus, a grave flaw that has continued since the onset of the outbreak, in a CNN interview.Currently, Italy is leading globally with over 6,000 deaths and is likely to stop treatment for individuals over 80 and in poor health. A specific error Dr. Palù highlights is how the Italian government ignored testing in an area with the virus:“We should have done more diagnostic tests in Lombardy where there was a big nucleus. There is no sense in trying to go to the supermarket once a week. You have to limit your time out, isolation is the key thing.”Why?He alleges the government was “lazy in the beginning… too much politics in Italy.”Dr. Palù adds: “There was a proposal to isolate people coming from the epicenter, coming from China. Then it became seen as racist, but they were people coming from the outbreak.”Even according to CNN, fear of being viewed as racist “led to the current devastating situation.”Look no further than Dario Nardella, the left-wing Mayor of Florence, who urged Italians to “hug a Chinese” in early February –nearly 2 months after the first documented case of the virus – out of concern that the virus was spawning anti-Chinese racism.He even posted a video where he takes his own advice, using a man of Chinese-origin as a prop for his “anti-racist” video.#coronavirus: seguiamo le indicazioni delle autorità sanitarie e usiamo cautela, ma nessun terrorismo psicologico e soprattutto basta con i soliti sciacalli che non vedevano l’ora di usare questa scusa per odiare e insultare.

118,Politics,Coronavirus: The Open Borders Policy Killer,"COVID-19 has dominated national (and international) news cycle over the past month, and in the past week, all major sports leagues have cancelled or postponed their seasons, events such as E3 and the Houston Rodeo have been shut down, and even Disneyland is closing its doors.Leftist pundits, the hammers for whom every crisis is a socialist nail, have responded by attacking the President for either too much action or inaction, depending on the day, and also by doubling down on their demand for open borders.The Democratic Party has effectively campaigned for open borders for years now.President Obama famously used executive orders to deprioritize prosecution of certain illegal immigrants. Every Democratic candidate who began the presidential primary agreed that illegal immigrants should be allowed access to free healthcare.Recently, progressive justices on the Supreme Court argued states should not be allowed to prosecute illegal immigrants for identity theft. The left is fully invested now in importing millions of illegal immigrants and will not let a worldwide pandemic stop them.Globalists consider the free movement of goods and people to be worth any price.In fact, they like to pretend there is absolutely no downside to open borders. “The Coronavirus Pandemic is one of many reasons neo-nationalism is destructive & ultimately futile. Viruses… don’t care about lines on a map,” tweeted Harvard psychologist and open borders advocate Steven Pinker.The Coronavirus Pandemic is one of many reasons neo-nationalism is destructive & ultimately futile. Viruses (like greenhouse gases, cybercriminals, dark money, terrorists, pirates, & technology) don’t care about lines on a map.  https://t.co/fWt72EnzPn— Steven Pinker (@sapinker) March 1, 2020Yet history, both ancient and recent, shows that viruses can indeed be stopped by lines on a map.Viruses depend upon human hosts for transmission, and by containing the movement of people you can contain the spread of the virus. Our ancestors knew this, even without the knowledge of epidemiology or germ theory that we enjoy today.The Mosaic Laws of the Bible instruct people suffering from leprosy to live apart from society as long as they exhibited signs of disease. During the Black Plague in Europe, the city of Ragusa (modern day Dubrovnik, Croatia) instituted a system of isolating travelers from diseased areas for 40 days. Quaraginta literally means “40 days” in Latin, the origin of our word “quarantine”.During the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1918, places such as American Samoa and Yerba Buena Island in San Francisco shut themselves off from the outside world and waited for the disease to take its course. These places ended up having a much lower percentage of infections and deaths than places that remained open to travelers. Quarantines work.Yet the globalist left is determined to never let a serious crisis go to waste, as President Obama’s chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel said about the Great Recession.The media is using the pandemic as an opportunity to gaslight the American people into believing that borders and walls somehow increase our risk for infection.Nations that are serious about protecting their citizens have closed their borders and instituted quarantine procedures.Israel began strict screening procedures several weeks ago. Hungary has closed its borders as well. Italy placed their entire country on lockdown to try and contain the outbreak that has ravaged their people. The time to contain a pandemic, however, is before it spreads.President Trump proactively banned travel from China in January, a move that was attacked as premature and xenophobic by the left, but even that was not enough to keep the virus from our shores.Nevertheless, it surely kept the problem from getting worse. “There’s no question that if we had not done that in a timely way, there would’ve been many more travel-related cases from China,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci earlier this week.History tells us that the way to keep our citizens safe from deadly pandemics such as COVID-19 is to take decisive action.President Trump announced further travel bans, including most of Europe as well as Iran, but even that is not enough. If the American government is serious about protecting its citizens, then it should halt all travel in and out of our country.Allow citizens to come home if necessary, but quarantine them as long as needed to ensure they are not bringing more disease with them.Even Canada, the favorite example of benevolent socialism for the American left, has closed its borders. It is time for us to do likewise, without worrying about being called racist or xenophobic. The Democrats and their friends in the media are not serious about protecting American lives; they are just using this crisis to push their same old politics.A nation WITHOUT BORDERS is not a nation at all. We must have a wall. The rule of law matters. Jeb just doesn’t get it.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2015The reason why national borders exist is to protect the citizens of that nation from external threats, whether those threats are invading soldiers or carriers of a deadly virus. “A nation without borders is not a nation at all,” said Donald Trump on the campaign trail in 2015. He is right, and now more than ever is the time to use those borders to protect the American people.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/coronavirus-open-borders-killer/

They have very few regulations, do not enforce intellectual property laws, and workers can be paid cheaply.However, the profits of any industry or a single company should not come before the vital interests of the United States.The U.S. offers advantages few other countries in the world offer; we are remarkably stable and create the best quality goods in the world across a plethora of industries.So how does the U.S. bring back manufacturing and change the supply chain?First, President Trump was right to raise the concern of bringing back production to the U.S. during the 2016 election. Now that the country and Republicans in Congress have similar interests, there are methods that the government can take to help bring back our manufacturing.To stimulate our manufacturing economy, first and foremost, Congress should ban granting government contracts to companies that manufacture vital supplies overseas. Our legislators should follow up by placing caps on how much of anyone industry, especially in medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, could be purchased from any one country.This is especially true of the 400 essential medicines that President Trump outlined in his recent executive order. That way, China would not be allowed to monopolize the industry, and a specific portion of the jobs could come back to the US.To further incentivize private industry, Congress must act to create an infrastructure program that would bring jobs back to areas that were industrial powerhouses left just several decades ago.A study by The Alliance for American Manufacturing found that by investing in our infrastructure, over 150,000 factory jobs could return to the Rust Belt states.Furthermore, we should deregulate our natural resources, so the U.S. no longer has to rely on China’s monopoly. This will help further break up our dependency on China when it comes to a myriad of industries, including computers, technology, and cell phones.We cannot leave the viability of America’s economy and healthcare up to the whims, values, and crises of other nations across the globe who do not have our best interests.We may escape economic tragedy this time, but we should be prepared for a similar disruptive event and not allow China or any other nation to determine our fate.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/post-coronavirus-us-supply-chain/
120,Politics,Hong Kong ‘Beat’ Coronavirus. But Now – After Easing Restrictions Too Fast – It’s Back.,"Hong Kong was a model of how to handle the novel coronavirus. But now it’s coming back.In early March, Time magazine called the region “a lodestar for its ability to seemingly keep the disease at bay”, but the mistake of sending people back to work before the virus was truly dealt with was not far off.In the first week of March, Hong Kong tried to return to a semblance of normality. Their cases have ticked up ever since.The key to their initial successes (see February, above) was the aggressive response:By Feb. 1, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore had all proactively implemented travel restrictions on passengers coming from the mainland, contravening the World Health Organization’s [WHO] insistence that travel bans were not necessary. The precautions came at a significant economic cost to these international hubs, which all rely on mainland China as their biggest trading partner and source of tourists.The outright proscription of social gatherings paid huge dividends:…Hong Kong quickly put social distancing into practice. Schools remain closed through Easter. Normally bustling shopping streets, in some of the world’s most densely packed districts, are largely devoid of foot traffic as residents voluntarily stay sequestered at home. Many businesses have either shuttered or asked employees to work from home. Movie theaters, churches and basketball courts sit empty. Mass gatherings are canceled.Discussing the attitude of Hong Kongers – many of whom have been embroiled in a years-long struggle against their authoritarian, Chinese-controlled government – David Hui, director of the Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong said:“People are quite cautious now when they face a major outbreak of an infection… so they are actually compliant with public health measures even though they don’t like the government.”At the time Hui also warned the U.S. needed to go the same route, though feared for the process here due to the politicization of the coronavirus.Now, Hong Kong’s troubles may be sneaking back in.Reflecting upon the relaxed rules, James Griffiths reported:It was natural therefore that people began to relax somewhat, not only going to work instead of staying home, but also having dinner together, going to the park, and attending weddings and other large social gatherings. While face masks were still common, some people could be spotted going uncovered, particularly for short trips, and there was a general sense of slowly getting back to normal.And many of the recent new round of cases have been from people overseas returning to Hong Kong:In Hong Kong, 36 of the 48 COVID-19 cases reported Friday had overseas travel records, Dr. Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the communicable disease branch of Hong Kong’s Centre for Health Protection, said during an afternoon press conference. The cases involve travel to over a dozen countries, including Singapore, the Philippines, Austria, Portugal, United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The newly confirmed cases brings the total in Hong Kong to 256.The Hong Kong executive has now announced a new round of plans to deal with an uptick in cases, including barring non-citizens; halting transit through the international airport; testing anyone new arriving; and once again shuttering bars and restaurants.In other words, Hong Kong is having to hit the reset button on its attempts to stop COVID-19.With increased calls to “reopen America’s economy” after just 7 days in mild lockdown, we would perhaps do well to heed the eventual (rather than the initial) example as it comes from Hong Kong: not so fast. ",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/hong-kong-coronavirus-back/
121,Politics,Chloroquine: What Do We Know?,"As the numbers of infected and dead coronavirus patients continue to tick up, we’ve begun to hear of hydroxychloroquine, a well-known anti-viral drug used for years to treat malaria, Lyme disease, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Chloroquine is FDA-approved and has been for many years. It is available and inexpensive (as low as 3 cents per pill for hydroxychloroquine). There appears to be some evidence that this is effective in treating COVID-19. Three medical studies have confirmed that in using chloroquine to treat the virus, one hundred percent of patients treated have been cured, in as little as six days. No one has died.This could be the game-changer of game-changers.While chloroquine has not yet been FDA-approved to treat COVID-19, some doctors are already using it. Dr. William Grace, an oncologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, appeared on Fox News on Thursday night, telling host Laura Ingraham that doctors at his hospital had treated almost one hundred ‘very sick’ COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic form of chloroquine, and Azithromycin.There have been no deaths among these patients. He says colleagues at other New York hospitals are also using it, and there have been no deaths at these facilities, either. Dr. Grace was careful to note they were only using it with patients who showed ‘major respiratory compromise’, that the real danger with the virus was having the patient’s lungs fill with fluid, something the drug tended to arrest. Ingraham noted that just because the drug had not yet been FDA-approved for use in treating COVID-19, it did not mean that doctors could not use it in clinical settings. As with all medications, chloroquine can have side effects.As recently as 2013, the FDA relabeled the warnings on chloroquine to include possible side effects such as dizziness, loss of balance, ringing in the ears, anxiety, depression, and hallucinations. But it’s important to note many patients do not experience these effects at all, and for those that do, these side effects are serious but do not lead to fatalities. At the same time, we’re also learning that malaria outbreaks in countries which regularly experience them might be a predicting factor in how many cases of COVID-19 break out in that country. In a strange inverse ratio, the more cases of malaria a country experiences regularly, the fewer cases of COVID-19 seem to be showing up in those countries.Is this just a coincidence, or is it an important consideration in potentially identifying, quantifying and/or treating this pandemicConsider what Dr. Roy Spencer, Principal Research Scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville since 2001, posted on his Facebook page on March 18th:WOW.On the subject of using antimalarial drugs for COVID-19 treatment, I've compared COVID-19 cases versus malaria…Posted by Roy W. Spencer on Wednesday, March 18, 2020As investigators look further at this interesting relationship between malaria and COVID-19, it’s important to determine, if these numbers hold up with additional analysis, why this is so. And is it possible that since countries affected by malaria are already using chloroquine as an effective remedy, and since presumably at least part of their population in the recent past has used chloroquine as a treatment for malaria… could the chloroquine they had ingested previously be already, somehow, protecting them from developing COVID-19?Maybe the real correlation here is that countries using chloroquine regularly for another reason are already protecting their population (even if unknowingly) against another deadly virus. If so, chloroquine’s efficacy as a prophylactic may already be at least partially proven.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/chloroquine-what-do-we-know/
122,Politics,"Abortion Lobby Demands Hospitals Classify Procedure As ‘Essential,’ Augment With ‘Abortion Via Telemedicine’","Despite the coronavirus pandemic, abortion advocates are resolute in their crusade to ensure women can readily terminate a baby’s life by pushing for hospitals to classify the procedure as essential.With coronavirus pushing an estimated 30,000 cases in the United States, raising concerns about an impending strain on hospital resources including beds and ventilators, elective operations are being halted nationwide in response. In addition, many non-essential businesses, a category abortion clinics could fall under, have been compelled to close by state and local government fiat.Abortion advocates and lobbyists are panicking.A joint statement from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Board of Obstetrics & Gynecology, the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists, the American Gynecological & Obstetrical Society, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Society of Family Planning, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine articulated these fears: “Some health systems, at the guidance of the CDC, are implementing plans to cancel elective and non-urgent procedures to expand hospitals’ capacity to provide critical care. While most abortion care is delivered in outpatient settings, in some cases care may be delivered in hospital-based settings or surgical facilities. To the extent that hospital systems or ambulatory surgical facilities are categorizing procedures that can be delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, abortion should not be categorized as such a procedure. Abortion is an essential component of comprehensive health care. It is also a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible. The consequences of being unable to obtain an abortion profoundly impact a person’s life, health, and well-being.”In other words, abortion is tantamount to the coronavirus.The National Abortion Federation chimed in as well:“During this public health crisis, pregnancy care, including abortion care, remains an essential health service. The National Abortion Federation (NAF) calls on leaders to ensure that outpatient abortion clinics can remain open and urges hospitals to continue to provide abortion care. […] An individual and family decide to end a pregnancy for a complex constellation of reasons that include the impact of pregnancy and birth on their health, ability to work, and strained economic circumstances. These are conditions that do not go away—and are likely heightened—in pandemic conditions.“And the industry practices what it preaches: the nation’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, has kept its doors open.Similarly, the pro-choice activists in the mainstream media cabal have lamented “abortion access is under threat as coronavirus spreads” and are capitalizing on the opportunity to make the procedure, already predominantly elective, even more accessible. Various outlets insisted “Coronavirus is making the case for abortion via telemedicine.”Even as coronavirus kills hundreds of thousands globally, the abortion industry still hasn’t gained appreciation for the sanctity of human life.",https://thenationalpulse.com/social-issues/abortion-lobby-frets/
123,Politics,"China’s Western Propaganda Group, in 90 U.S. Universities, Promotes ‘Timely, Transparent, Open And Effective’ CCP Response to Coronavirus Outbreak","The Confucius Institute is living up to its reputation as the international propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party with its response to the novel coronavirus, extolling the CCP’s response as “timely, transparent, open and effective.”Reality is far different from this CCP-sanctioned narrative: at first, the regime ignored the existence of the virus, repeatedly threatening doctors who raised concerns that “if they kept being stubborn, with such impertinence, and continue this illegal activity, they would be brought to justice.”Even a University of Southampton study concluded a 95 percent reduction in global coronavirus cases would have resulted if the CCP addressed the virus in its infancy – a stark contrast from the Confucius Institute proclaiming the regime’s “comprehensive” response to the virus demonstrated the CCP’s ability to “once again creates miracles with Chinese speed.”Confucius Institute HQ, via a press release, alleges:“After the outbreak of the epidemic, the Chinese side has, in the spirit of being responsible for people’s health and for global public health, taken the most comprehensive and strict prevention and control measures, share the information of the epidemic and the gene sequence of the novel coronavirus with the relevant parties in a timely, transparent, open and effective manner.”The message clearly distances the CCP from any responsibility and depicts the regime as saving the day – far from the truth.The statement continues, alleging the regime’s self-proclaimed “timely, transparent, open and effective” response has been extolled by several international bodies and leaders: “The measures taken by the Chinese side have effectively prevented the spread of the epidemic worldwide, which has been fully recognized and highly valued by the World Health Organization and many countries.”The rest of the report emphasizes the unity and strength of China’s response with meaningless platitudes: “We believe sincerity and kindness will overcome estrangement, while care and compassion will not be shadowed by panic and fear.”It concludes with: “Let us join hands to tackle the current difficulties!”In other words, the CCP believes it should be able to spawn a virus, exacerbate the spread by mishandling it, disseminate propaganda globally divorcing itself from any responsibility, and then “join hands” – that’s not happening under President Trump’s watch.The Confucius Institute has embedded itself in nearly 90 American universities, and its critics assert it disseminates propaganda on behalf of the CCP and engages in intellectual property theft.It’s also a recent target of a legislation introduced by Senator Lankford to “minimize Chinese efforts to exert inappropriate influence on American university campuses through Confucius Institutes, which repress free speech and discourage transparency.”",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/confucius-institute-response/
124,Politics,"Belgian Govt Gifts Masks To Refugees, Leaves Hospitals Begging Citizens For Masks","Belgium’s government instructed citizens to wash their hands as an adequate defense against the novel coronavirus. Meanwhile, the country’s sizable refugee population received high-quality protective masks.Minister of Health and Secretary of State for Asylum and Migration Maggie De Block placed an order for over $30,000 worth of surgical masks for the Klein Kasteeltje center for asylum seekers while simultaneously appearing on several television programs to push government’s official recommendation that washing hands was an adequate defense against the potentially deadly virus.And only one of those – masks – is a comprehensive, CDC-approved defense against coronavirus.While the massive mask order could certainly be viewed as a protective measure considering many refugees could have been exposed to the virus and hail from countries with significantly less developed healthcare systems, it begs the question as to why the government is allowing refugees in in the first place, let alone during a global pandemic.While left-wing politicians might glorify mass migration-induced diversity, the fiscal, cultural, and health impacts suggest otherwise.And the Belgian government already has enough Coronavirus-induced crises to grapple with: at the time of writing, Belgium is about to surpass 1,500 cases of Coronavirus and reach nearly 20 deaths.The country is also facing a severe shortage of masks after placing an order for five million from a fraudulent Turkish supplier, compelling “very concerned” medical professionals to implore citizens to donate personal masks and protective gear to hospitals nationwide.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/refugee-health-prioritized/
125,Politics,"Tulsi Gabbard, Bullied Out by the DNC, Should Summon the Courage to Whistleblow on Phony Democrats","Following the first presidential debate on June 26th, Tulsi Gabbard was the most searched candidate on Google. She was, at that time, a credible Democratic Party candidate.Almost immediately after, her Google Ads account was suspended without warning. This resulted in a lawsuit alleging that Google used its influence to “silence” Gabbard, who missed out on campaign donations as a result.Prior to the third debate on September 12, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) sent a memo to all the campaigns saying they had changed their debate qualification process. This memo set a deadline of August 28th to reach 130,000 donors as well as a polling threshold, which Gabbard was ultimately unable to meet.Soon after, she appeared on Tucker Carlson Tonight to communicate a “lack of transparency” on the part of the DNC, which created a “lack of faith and trust in the process”.Prior to the October debate, she even threatened to boycott, claiming “[t]he DNC and the corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process”.Seemingly on cue, Hillary Clinton alleged on October 17 that Gabbard was being “groomed by Russia” to run as a third-party candidate. Gabbard later filed suit against Clinton for defamation because of this comment. The damage to her campaign was likely incalculable given Clinton’s lasting influence amongst Democratic voters.This event marked a change in tone with respect to Gabbard’s campaign.The November debate was “largely an amiable affair” with the exception of Gabbard. In addition to Clinton, she became a target of the other candidates as well. Kamala Harris suggested Gabbard’s history of criticizing the Obama administration was “unfortunate” and that she “buddied up to Steve Bannon”. Pete Buttigieg attacked her judgement for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a “murderous dictator”.Gabbard failed to qualify for the following five Democratic debates. The Friday before last, the DNC announced new qualifying standards for this month’s debate, leaving only Biden and Sanders to participate.Gabbard just dropped out of the race and sadly endorsed Joe Biden.Her decision to stick with the Democratic establishment despite their treatment of her boggles the mind.In a recent CNN panel, Anderson Cooper suggested Gabbard only remained in the race in order “to be a Fox contributor.”The cumulative effect of DNC rule changes and public attacks stifled Gabbard’s visibility to potential voters.Contrast her experiences with DNC rule changes with that of Michael Bloomberg and his three month candidacy.In January, the DNC again announced rule changes for the February 19 debate in Nevada. The new qualification standards would “scrap the grassroots funding support threshold”, according to NPR. As such, Bloomberg was not required to demonstrate grassroots fundraising support like every other candidate in previous debates.His self-financed campaign and unprecedented spending “allowed him to quickly create a narrative about himself”, per CNN. Eventually, some media pundits even asserted “Michael Bloomberg is the most electable Democrat.”This demonstrates the peculiarity of this election cycle to date.At the beginning of debate season, the democratic field was celebrated for its “unprecedented diversity”. But by the December debate, it was criticized for having five male candidates and six white candidates.While Gabbard would have met the DNC’s need for diversity, she was unable to qualify because of their own changing rules.In a cultural atmosphere of increase “wokeness” and open endorsement of socialism, a billionaire white male was able to get fourth place in the DNC presidential race. The only remaining candidates with a chance at victory are facing widespread concern of health problems.Tulsi Gabbard’s was bullied out of the race by a party that claims to work more in her interests than those of Bloomberg, or even Biden. At one point in time, however, she generated more interest than any other candidate. So why – given she’s no longer a candidate – did she endorse Biden and the broken DNC?",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/gabbard-bullied-out-by-the-dnc/
126,Politics,Confucius Institute Targets Elementary School Choir In Quest To Absolve CCP Of Coronavirus Blame,"Irish school children are the latest victims of the Chinese Communist Party’s international propaganda machine – the Confucius Institute – which compelled a children’s choir to dedicate a song to China in light of the Coronavirus pandemic.The Chinese song, “Let the World be Full of Love,” and the optics of the performance paint China as the chief victim of the outbreak, ignoring the fact that the CCP’s initial response to the virus was silencing those who raised any concern, accusing the heroic whistleblowers of “making false comments” and “severely disturbing the social order.”Similarly, a University of Southampton study also found that there would have been a 95 percent reduction in Coronavirus cases globally had the CCP proactively intervened just three weeks sooner.Emboldened by the American political establishment’s decades-long policies of appeasement to maximize profit margins at the expense of American workers, the CCP is rebuffing any responsibility for the virus.In fact, they’re actively placing blame on other countries, chiefly the United States.  The Confucius Institute at Ulster University organized a choir of 30 children aged eight to 13 to sing a song in Chinese dedicated to the victims of the virus, with the broader message turning a blind eye to China’s culpability for spawning and spreading the virus.The performance was coordinated by 16 Confucius Institute-affiliated professors from Hubei province, the epicenter of the virus, and turned the students into a 21st century equivalent of Mao Zedong’s “Little Red Guards.”Such displays are part of the Confucius Institute’s MO: to advance pro-CCP message throughout the world. They have established presences on roughly 90 American college campuses and along with functioning as the international propaganda arm of the CCP have been accused of engaging in intellectual property theft.While China may have gotten a free pass for Coronavirus in the establishment-dominated Bush and Obama eras, President Trump will hold the regime accountable.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/confucius-institutes-quest/
127,Politics,CBS Glorifies China’s Response to Coronavirus,"CBS hailed China’s response to the novel Coronavirus as a “lesson” for the United States, alleging the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) comprehensively “attacked” the virus.It’s a prime example of fake news styled after Chinese propaganda, especially considering the CCP denied the existence of the virus in its infancy and remains unwilling to accept blame for spawning a global pandemic.The only thing the CCP “attacked” was the first Coronavirus whistleblower, Dr. Li Wenliang, who had police sent to his home after he alerted fellow health professionals about the virus.Dr. Li was forced to return to work, forced by the CCP to ignore the impending coronavirus catastrophe, and was exposed to the virus, dying weeks later. He was then called to the Public Security Bureau and forced to sign a letter declaring he “made false comments” that had “severely disturbed the social order.”The CCP also admonished: “We solemnly warn you: If you keep being stubborn, with such impertinence, and continue this illegal activity, you will be brought to justice – is that understood?”And an additional eight individuals were investigated for “spreading rumors” (read: pursuing the truth).Yet CBS believes characterizes the CCP’s response to the virus as: “In China, the government attacked.”The report continues, extolling praise on the response in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus: “In the epidemic’s heart of Wuhan, city officials built two hospitals with more than 2,000 beds in the span of a few weeks. To stop the spread, a massive lockdown radiated out to nearly 60 million people across central China strong-arm tactics were used against people who refused to wear masks, with some beaten while others were locked into their homes, forcefully quarantined.”And there’s another fault in CBS’s logic.The evidence the network uses to allege the CCP adequately responded to the virus is directly from the CCP – the same power-hungry regime that denied the existence of coronavirus in the first place: “And new incredible stat out of China just today. The country reported just one, only one new domestic coronavirus case. There were 20 more, but those were imported from people traveling in from overseas. And anyone doing that gets to face a mandatory 14-day quarantine, and that’s on their own dime.”While CBS may stand for Columbia Broadcasting System, it’s the de facto Chinese Broadcasting System.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/cbs-glorifies-china/

And a host of other countries – Germany, Canada, Poland, and more – have done the same.While the United States has barred the entry of all non-citizens who visited high-risk areas including China, Iran and several European countries, President Trump has a prime opportunity to do even more; he can turn his America First border policy into reality.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/migrants-with-coronavirus/
129,Politics,Jeff Sessions is Still Best For Alabama,"President Donald Trump officially endorsed Tommy Tuberville, spurning his former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the Alabama Senate race. Tommy Tuberville (@TTuberville) is running for the U.S. Senate from the Great State of Alabama. Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University. He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down! Tommy will protect your Second Amendment….— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 11, 2020Sessions fell out of favor with the President and was fired from the post of Attorney General in 2018 after he recused himself from the Justice Department’s Russia investigation.“This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn’t have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!” Trump tweeted after Sessions fell short of winning the Alabama Senate Primary.Tuberville a former football coach turned politician is leading according to the latest polls, and with Trump’s endorsement may build an insurmountable lead over Sessions heading into the runoff election. But as we have learned with so many politicians who are on board with Trump’s agenda until it really matters, this choice may be a mistake.The differences between the two candidates may at times seem to be few and far between. Indeed, this race has largely appeared to be about which candidate is a bigger supporter of President Trump and his agenda. But when you look closer there are key differences which make the choice clear.The bottom line is that Jeff Sessions is someone that can be counted on to push conservative priorities and advance President Trump’s agenda, while Tuberville is, at best, an inexperienced candidate with concerning comments raising warning flags about how his views actually line up with conservative policy.Sessions was elected to the Senate in 1997 where he served until he was nominated as Attorney General in 2017. During his time in the Senate, he was consistently viewed as one of its most conservative members and has always been one of President Trump’s most vocal and active supporters. Sessions was the first sitting Senator to endorse Trump in 2016 and even after the President’s endorsement of Tuberville he came out on twitter stating that he still stood behind President Trump’s agenda:“Even before he declared for the presidency, I fought for the principles that Donald Trump so effectively advocated in the campaign and has advanced as President. I believed in those principles then, I have always fought for them, and I will continue to do so.”– Jeff SessionsTuberville on the other hand has no political experience, is seen as a Republican in name only by many conservatives, and some of his past comments cast doubts on his claims of being 100 percent behind President Trump’s America First agenda.Since announcing his candidacy last year Tuberville has, in several speeches, advocated for immigrants to cross the border and fill jobs that would otherwise go to American workers.During a 2019 speech Tuberville gave, he said:“We got 100,000 people a month coming across the border. We don’t know who they are. We need them. But at least we got to know who they are.”His campaign also hired Rob Jesmer, Zuckerberg’s chief GOP aide for FWD.us, and a former John McCain for president employee.Jesmer is believed to have been influential in lobbying GOP members of Congress to support amnesty for illegal aliens with the promise of border enforcement, and additional foreign guest workers for multinational corporations such as Facebook.As recently as 2017, FWD.us lobbied Congress in an attempt to pass the Dream Act giving amnesty to a majority of the anywhere from 10 to 20 million illegal immigrants residing in the United States.These comments are eerily similar to Joe Biden and other mainstream Democrats’ positions on immigration and bring up a valid concern about Tuberville’s intention on immigration if he does become Alabama’s next Senator.In a State that is overwhelmingly pro Trump and pro Republican, Alabama should choose a candidate that will fight to stop the left’s push for amnesty and unwaveringly fight for American working families.As Republicans head to the polls in July, they would do good to remember that Jeff Sessions is a terrific conservative, a principled man, and if there was ever a politician that stood for the Trump agenda, it is Jeff Sessions.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/sessions-still-best-alabama/
130,Politics,"China’s Propaganda Extends Into Elementary, Middle, and High Schools","China’s immediate goal is to “change the impression in the United States and around the world that China is an economic and security threat,” according to a 2019 Senate Report. The Chinese government – a dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) – wants to downplay atrocities like the massacre at Tiananmen Square in 1989 and the ongoing battle for Tibetan independence.China is working to achieve their goal using programs and recruitment plans in the fields of science and education that reach the very roots of American society and national security.Harvard University Professor Charles Lieber was arrested in January and charged with lying about his connection to the Chinese government. Two Chinese nationals, both also working in sensitive research fields, were charged on the same day in separate cases stemming from visa fraud and the attempted smuggling of 21 vials of biological research to China.Lieber, who chaired the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard, received over $15 million in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense (DOD). The grants require disclosure of financial support from foreign governments and entities.Coincidentally, Lieber joined the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) as a “Strategic Scientist” in 2011 and was participating in China’s Thousand Talents Plan from 2012-2017 according to the Department of Justice (DOJ) report released on January 28.Lieber was living large during his time with WUT, which paid him $50,000 a month, plus nearly $158,000 for living expenses on top of $1.5 million to build a research facility at WUT.The Thousand Talents Plan describes its mission as the “aim to gather the global wisdom and create the China great exploit.”The Plan is a recruitment program used by China to tempt the most talented scientific minds in the world to “bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information,” according to a DOJ press release.There are over 100 CCP-funded Confucius Institutes operating in the United States.Confucius Institutes offer Chinese teachers to teach Chinese language classes to student and non-student communities at higher learning campuses worldwide. The Institutes hold “cultural events”, dances, and other CCP-approved entertainment meant to show the softer side of the totalitarian state.Colleges and universities are not the only educational institutions facing Chinese propaganda.Over 500 elementary, middle, and high schools in the United States participate with the Confucius Institutes to bring “Confucius Classrooms” to a younger audience.Confucius Classrooms and Confucius Institutes rely on CCP-funding that restricts academic freedom. Anything that casts a disparaging or even questioning light on China’s communist government is not allowed, per Rob Portman’s Senate Report.China’s foothold in American education and scientific research provides a springboard for programs like the Thousand Talents Plan and other espionage efforts.Both of the foreign nationals, who were charged at the same time as Lieber, were working in sensitive scientific research fields at prominent facilities in Boston when their alleged crimes were committed. The charges against them range from visa fraud to acting as a foreign to conspiracy and involve trade and research secrets.In China’s hands, America’s secrets are used to make cheap consumer goods, military equipment, and medical technologies which are then sold back to the U.S. for a large payoff that is more than just money.The loss of intellectual property and other sensitive information is a threat to America’s sovereignty, economic status, and national security.“Without action to close the gap, ‘foreigners’ will eventually own so much of America that there will be nothing left to trade,” Assistant to the President and Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro said in regard to the global supply chain in 2017.President Trump’s administration has been working to rebuild America’s manufacturing in an effort to reclaim the global supply chain since his election. Manufacturers now have more incentives to return or stay in the United States thanks to regulatory, tax and policy reforms enacted by the administration.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is working to mitigate any likely interruptions to the supply chain for vital medical supplies during the coronavirus outbreak. The FDA is monitoring the supply of drugs, ingredients and medical devices in conjunction with manufacturers.As many media outlets furiously question the President’s motives in calling the novel coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” the most recent calamities as far as global health is concerned proves that Trump’s problem with China is America’s problem with China.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/china-propaganda-schools/
131,Politics,"Rep. Banks Calls For Reparations From China: ‘Opportunity, Avenue, And Appetite To Make Them Pay’","Representative Jim Banks called for reparations from the Chinese Communist Party for spawning the novel Coronavirus, asserting there is “opportunity, avenue, and appetite to make China pay” on Tucker Carlson Tonight. Coronavirus is not the first time the CCP’s relentless pursuit of  power has harmed America’s health and economy. Outsourcing, currency manipulation, and intellectual property theft have unfairly disadvantaged American workers and poor environmental and health standards have led to unprecedented pollution and toxic products for consumers – all while the American political establishment turns a blind eye.But this doctrine of appeasement has been reversed by President Trump, a much-needed shift highlighted by Rep. Banks, who holds the CCP culpable for Coronavirus-induced economic hardship, including a Dow plunge of nearly 3,000 points and forced closures of thousands of restaurants and stores.I joined @tuckercarlson last night to discuss how we can begin to demand reparations from Communist #China for putting us through the economic strain of #coronavirus. Watch below: pic.twitter.com/YEAHJpkoLv— Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) March 17, 2020During the segment, Carlson asks: “You’ve been one of the few and loudest voices calling attention to the threat that China poses to the United States. Do you think that this crisis will awaken your colleagues to this threat?”Rep. Banks responds: “There’s no doubt about it, Tucker. I’ve heard from colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are ready to engage in the same fight I’ve been fighting now for several months to hold China accountable for their bad behavior. We need to start by forcing China to pay the burden and the cost incurred on the United States of America due to the Coronavirus.”Rep. Banks continues, proposing the CCP forgive America’s debt or the Trump administration increase tariffs: “I think there are many ways we could do that. The president could force China to relieve a great amount of American debt, he could institute tariffs on China and designate the funds from that into a Coronavirus victim relief fund to pay the cost incurred on Americans and American taxpayers due to the negligence on China’s behalf that has led to this crisis in America today.”Carlson inquires about the feasibility of such a proposal: “So by erasing the US debt held by the Chinese we could fund that. Do you think the administration is willing to push for that?”Rep. Banks responds confidently with faith in President Trump: “I hope so. President Trump has shown enormous strength and effort so far in the trade deal. When we talk about future trade deals, there’s an opportunity, avenue, and I believe appetite, to go after China to make them pay even further costs. So I hope that would be the case, but I have no doubt that President Trump will do everything that he can to hold China accountable for what they have caused on Americans today.”The CCP, aided and abetted by the American establishment, have harmed American workers for too long, and Coronavirus is the latest example – not merely an isolated incident – of this misconduct going unchecked.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/china-reparations/
132,Politics,China’s Digital ‘Wu Mao’ Army Target Trump Over Coronavirus,"China’s “wu mao”, or “50 cent”, digital army has been relentlessly attacking the United States – especially the timeline of President Trump – since the onset of the COVID-19 coronavirus.Yesterday I detailed how the real-life bots – named for how much they’re believed to be paid per post, not after the rapper – were spreading conspiracy theories about the coronavirus emanating from the United States.Today I wanted to show you just how virulent this problem is becoming, especially in a U.S. election year.“Wu mao” is a term that came to light in 2016. Voice of America reported “[t]he ’50 Cent Army’ is a group of state-backed internet commenters whose numbers have reportedly ranged from 500,000 to two million.”Now they’re being deployed against President Trump and his coronavirus response.As yet, major news networks have failed to report on the matter, despite fairly obviously over-hyping attempted Russian interference in the 2016 election.This, despite wu mao-run accounts clearly targeting and misleading left-wing activists online with repetitive, false narratives.One wu mao response to a recent Trump tweet garnered 93 retweets and 7,000 likes. While many of the engagements were also from fraudulent accounts, many were not.The account tweeted: “As a Chinese working in the States, I am deeply worried and upset by Trump’s action. Thank you for speaking up! We work hard, obey any laws but we cannot vote. Please help to prevent the American going down to this hatred dark path!”In fact, the account – which hadn’t tweeted since May 2014 – suddenly began sending variants of the above message to multiple accounts, until American accounts on the political left took the bait.The CCP message was echoed by anti-Trump, pro-“#resistance” accounts, as well as Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang fan accounts.Wu Mao is an insult. A pejorative in the online world.They routinely target pro-Hong Kong freedom accounts, as well as people who criticize the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its leader Xi Jinping.I’ve had my own interactions with wu mao since replying to a President Trump tweet that referred to COVID-19 as “the Chinese Virus.”“CHINESE VIRUS!!!” I replied, before being inundated with abuse – often of the racial variety – by wu mao on behalf of China.One new account – started in March 2020 – called me, “Indian human scum,” to which I replied, “I’m British. You’re Wumao.”This sent the account – which now protects its tweets – into a frenzy against me.“Stop putting dirt on other! How shameful you are! Bad karma will come to you!” the wu mao first replied.Then another, within two minutes: “Stop demonizing others! Stop put dirt on others! This is You!”And another, again demanding I stop claiming they were wu mao.The lady doth protest too much, methinks.The pattern can be repeated across Twitter, and has been ramping up for weeks.Wu mao often swing in behind Chinese government apparatchiks on Twitter. Ironic, given ordinary Chinese citizens aren’t allowed to use the platform.They also appear to be extremely touchy, and angry individuals.Unlike “Russian bots” which are said to have automated tweets and retweets during the 2016 election, the Chinese “bots” are actually a digital army of real people.In other words, you can reel them in.I’ve done it a few times now, and I’ve even started following some and offering them a cash reward for whistleblowing about who pays them and how they operate. One has already replied, broadly incoherently tweeting back at me:“Why don’t you just f*ck with your mum? She should take the responsibility for raising your as a JOKE. Maybe that’s why you genital-thinking bastards are so stupid ^ ^ oh wait, do you had a real mom? Could you figure out who she is? Or the person just your imagination?”The account, like the others, then locked themselves.In the meantime, I’ve reached out to Twitter’s Press Office, but they haven’t yet responded.",https://thenationalpulse.com/coronavirus/chinas-wu-mao-target-trumps/
133,Politics,"Showtime Turns Conservative, Christian Politician Into Gay Adulterer","A Christian, conservative, and married politician transformed into a gay adulterer on a recent episode of Showtime’s “Black Monday.”Airing March 15th, the episode comes just days after prominent, married Democratic politician Andrew Gillum was found alone in a Miami hotel room with a severely intoxicated gay male escort and bags of crystal meth. The former Tallahassee mayor ran a failed gubernatorial campaign against Ron DeSantis, gaining support from several high-profile Democrats including President Obama.Predictably, Hollywood and the legacy media including CBS-owned Showtime turned a blind eye, instead concocting an affair between a lobbyist and a married Republican, playing into the left’s “hypocritical Christian conservative” trope.While the series takes place in the 1980s, chronicling the lead-up and fallout of the 1987 “Black Monday” stock market crash, Hollywood writers thought it was imperative to include an adulterous gay love affair in the script.In the controversial episode, a major stockbroker, Blair Pfaff, attempts to persuade an influential congressman to spearhead legislation to deregulate banks.In response, Congressman Harris asks: “You want to rewrite U.S. law so you and your Wall Street cronies can buy up retail banks and use the savings of honest, God-fearing Americans to gamble on the stock market?”Eerily similar to the establishment-sanctioned bailouts of 2008 at the expense of the American taxpayer, Pfaff responds affirmatively: “My man! Yeah, do we have a deal?”Congressman Harris response highlights his religious, conservative values which the writers have him abandon minutes later: “I’m the chair of the House Ethics Committee. I started the Family Values Caucus, I coined the phrase, ‘Moral Majority.’ I invented the parental advisory stickers that protect kids from rap.” However, following this dialogue, Pfaff and the congressman, who also happens to be the son-in-law of a noted televangelist, kiss before entering a hotel bedroom alone.While political sex scandals are not confined to one side of the aisle, Hollywood’s depiction certainly makes it seem that way.Given the entertainment industry’s devotion to liberalism and rampant anti-Christian and anti-conservative bias, it’s clear this effort is intentional.",https://thenationalpulse.com/social-issues/conservative-becomes-gay/

135,Politics,Italy ‘Likely’ To Stop Coronavirus Care For Individuals in Poor Health,"If the novel coronavirus continues to spread at its current rate, leaving hospital beds and breathing machines in short supply, the Italian government will consider halting treatment for individuals over 80 or in poor health.This desperate measure is part of a new regional protocol written by the Italian government’s crisis management unit, although it’s currently only “draft plans drawn up for the next phase of the crisis.”However, according to reports from The Telegraph, “the document is already complete and only approval from a technical-scientific committee is needed before it is sent to hospitals. The criteria are expected to apply throughout Italy, government sources said.”The document outlines the criterion for care: “Access to intensive therapy in cases of emergency must include age of less than 80 or a score on the Charlson comorbidity Index [which indicates how many other medical conditions the patient has] of less than 5.”A patient’s likelihood of recovering from resuscitation will also influence doctors’ decisions.The document also notes how Italian healthcare infrastructure will be unlikely to sustain the inevitable number of Coronavirus cases: “The growth of the current epidemic makes it likely that a point of imbalance between the clinical needs of patients with COVID-19 and the effective availability of intensive resources will be reached. Should it become impossible to provide all patients with intensive care services, it will be necessary to apply criteria for access to intensive treatment, which depends on the limited resources available.”It continues: “The criteria set out guidelines if the situation becomes of such an exceptional nature as to make the therapeutic choices on the individual case dependent on the availability of resources, forcing [hospitals] to focus on those cases in which the cost/benefit ratio is more favorable for clinical treatment.”Doctors have responded with unease with one commenting, “this is how it is in a war.”The Italian government has already taken extreme measures to contain the spread of the disease given its sizable elderly population, including banning funerals, closing cemeteries, and shutting down thousands of senior centers. Despite this, Italy has over 1,000 deaths – second only to China – and the number is increasing every day.Of greatest concern is the fact that over 15,000 are infected, nearly three times the amount of intensive care beds Italy currently has.And the United States is facing a similar situation: a Coronavirus catastrophe induced by a shortage of medical supplies. Reports have shown a dearth of ventilators and hospital beds, with projected patients outnumbering the availability of supplies at least six-to-one.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/italy-coronavirus-care/

139,Commentary,EXCLUSIVE: Chinese Propaganda Attacking Steve Bannon Written by Fake ‘Security Analyst’ With Fraudulent Credentials,"CGTN.com, the official website for China’s Global Television Network, published a propaganda piece on Monday bashing former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.The article’s author appears to have faked the credentials of “Security Analyst” at the London School of Economics.Bannon has berated and exposed the Chinese Communist Party for their egregious human rights record, exploitative trade practices, and – most recently – their efforts to conceal the novel coronavirus from the world. “I think the world’s going to hold them in judgment, and that judgment is not going to be very pretty. They owe trillions, if not tens of trillions of dollars,” Bannon said on CNBC’s Squawk Box.In a piece for CGTN, Hannan Hussain – who claimed to be a security analyst at the London School of Economics’ South Asia Centre – wrote: “Contrary to Bannon’s claims, there are no trillions up for grabs, because Washington’s reckless handling of the pandemic – from suppression of information to a coordinated political campaign against China – has eclipsed the credibility of the serving administration.”The London School of Economics told The National Pulse in a statement post-publication of the original story:Mr Hussain is not a ‘Security Analyst’ with LSE South Asia Centre nor does he hold any other position at LSE. The position of ‘Security Analyst’ does not even exist at our Centre.Hussain’s propaganda piece for the Chinese Communist Party’s state-sanctioned news outlet predictably labels Steve Bannon a xenophobe, racist, etc. The piece also notes that some American academics, whom Hussain calls “lifelong threats to the likes of Bannon,” have disparaged Bannon’s reparations argument. As much as he hopes, Hussain is not unique. For decades, bureaucrats in Washington, Wall Street corporatists, and intellectual elites at institutional universities like Harvard have kowtowed to China’s brutal communist regime. Hussain appears to have published two blogs with the LSE in the past, but does not hold a position in the university.Even another of Hussain’s publishers – The Diplomat magazine – has listed China Central Television (CCTV) as “long standing weapon in Beijing’s arsenal of repression”.Do your editors @Diplomat_APAC know you're writing propaganda pieces for the ""long standing weapon in Beijing's arsenal of repression""? pic.twitter.com/GLwBW3l12j— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) May 4, 2020When asked to comment on his work for the Chinese Communist Party, Hussein blocked National Pulse editor Raheem Kassam.Preliminary US investigations indicate that, after learning of the possible pandemic, the Chinese government hid the information from the Chinese people for six days and allowed the city of Wuhan to host a mass banquet as millions began traveling for Lunar New Year celebrations. President Xi Jinping did not warn the Chinese people of the outbreak until the seventh day, January 20th. By this time, more than 3,000 people had already been infected.A leaked dossier from the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance – including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand – obtained exclusively by Australia’s Daily Telegraph newspaper finds that the Chinese Communist Party intentionally hid or destroyed evidence pertaining to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The report also highlights China’s suppression of evidence regarding the outbreak – including, but not limited to, bleaching wet market stalls, censoring evidence of asymptomatic carriers, and refusing to accommodate sample requests from other countries. Senior US intelligence officials told Fox News that the reports of the dossier are consistent with United States investigations into the origins of the outbreak. “I’ve been heartened to see Australia, other countries joining us, demanding an investigation, because while we know this started in Wuhan, China, we don’t yet know from where it started,” United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. “And in spite of our best efforts to get experts on the ground, they continue to try and hide and obfuscate.” Last Thursday, April 30th, President Trump also confirmed that he had personally seen intelligence linking the Wuhan Institute of Virology to the origin of the virus. When asked to elaborate, President Trump said: “I can’t tell you that, I’m not allowed to tell you that.” The Chinese Communist Party’s refusal to include outside actors in their investigations into the origins and spread of the novel coronavirus prove China-hawks like Steve Bannon are right to refer to the global pandemic as China’s “biological Chernobyl.”The 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster and USSR’s subsequent cover-up resulted in the endangerment of European populations and ultimately devastating loss of life. China’s botched response to the novel coronavirus pandemic seems to evidence Mark Twain’s famous maxim: “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Especially when it comes to communist regimes. This much we know: CCP running dogs like Hussain are on the wrong side of history. This article has been updated to reflect the statement by the London School of Economics asserting Mr Hussain holds no position there.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/chinas-global-television-network-steve-bannon-cant-be-trusted/
140,Commentary,New White House Press Sec Kayleigh McEnany Is a Class Act at the Podium,"If there’s one thing we have learned throughout the Trump administration it’s that, given the media’s irascible behavior, press briefings are no walk in the park. During her inaugural podium briefing, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany did not disappoint, handling her former colleagues in the media with grace and ease.Not only was this the first briefing held by McEnany since she assumed office, but it is the first podium briefing the White House has had in over a year.“I will never lie to you. You have my word on that,” she told reporters and the American people.“I am consistently with [Trump], absorbing his thinking, and it’s my mission to bring you the mindset of the president and deliver those facts.”During her half hour behind the podium, McEnany tackled many pressing and controversial issues in the media today, including China, General Flynn, Tara Reade’s sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden, and even the media coverage itself.Concise, thoughtful, and well prepared from @kayleighmcenany.— Raheem Kassam 😷 (@RaheemKassam) May 1, 2020As regards China, the Press Secretary criticized how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) handled the COVID-19 outbreak.“It’s no secret that China mishandled the situation,” she asserted, explaining how China “shut down the lab for ‘rectification,’ they’ve slow-walked information on a human to human transmission alongside the World Health Organization, and didn’t let the U.S. investigators in at a very important time.” McEnany added how China “did not share the genetic sequence [of the virus] until a professor in Shanghai did so on his own.”“So we take displeasure with China’s actions,” she concluded.China is not the only one with whom McEnany expressed ‘displeasure’.“There is a case of injustice that has yet to be brought up today, and I certainly would like to bring it up… What we’ve all learned from [General Flynn’s case] should scare every American citizen,” she said, as new evidence is coming to light that not only exonerates the former Trump advisor but incriminates former top ranking FBI officials, such as James Comey and Andrew McCabe.Outlining the case, McEnany explained: “You had Jim Comey admitting in December of last year that he violated a protocol by directing agents to confront Flynn, something that he ‘wouldn’t have gotten away with under previous administrations.’ The FBI told Flynn he didn’t need a lawyer when they came to meet with him. McCabe told FBI agents that he didn’t think Flynn was lying.”“And all of that information we’ve learned over the last few months and years culminates in the fact that we have a handwritten FBI note that says ‘we need to get Flynn to lie and get him fired.’”“There was an unfair target on the back of General Michael Flynn.” She reaffirmed: “It should concern every American anytime there’s a partisan pursuit of an individual, and…at least those questions are raised with regard to General Michael Flynn, an honorable man who served his country.”McEnany pushed back on the Democrats for similarly treating Justice Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court nomination when asked about the President saying Reade’s allegation against Biden is “far more compelling with anything they had with respect to Brett Kavanaugh.”“I think it was a grave miscarriage of justice what happened with Justice Brett Kavanaugh.,” she said. “There’s no need for me to bring up some of the salacious, awful, and un-verifiably false allegations that were made against Justice Kavanaugh.”Moreover she declared that it “was an embarrassment for the Democrat party to have dragged the name of a very respectable man through the mud like that.”True Statement by @PressSec pic.twitter.com/FoPWBdyd9d— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 1, 2020The Press Secretary also responded directly to the sexual assault allegations against 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden.“[The White House is] pleased the former vice president has decided to go on the record,” she said. “It took him, what, less than 16 hours to follow the advice of the president and go on record and publicly address those claims.”Reporters in the room quickly pivoted from Biden to Trump when it came to sexual assault allegations.“The President has swiftly denied all of these allegations that were raised four years ago,” McEnany responded to a question about past accusations made against the President..@PressSec @KayleighMcEnany: ""Leave it to the media to really take an issue about the former Vice President and turn it on the President."" pic.twitter.com/QViKObE3b6— The Hill (@thehill) May 1, 2020“He has always told the truth on these issues, he’s denied them immediately, and you’re bringing up issues, like I said, from four years ago that were asked and answered. And the American people had their say on the matter when they elected President Trump as President of the United States.”“Leave it to the media to really take an issue about the former Vice President and turn it on the President,” she pushed back.Many including Sarah Huckabee Sanders, former Press Secretary under President Trump, took to Twitter during and after the briefing to praise the new Press Secretary on her debut.“Proud of my friend Kayleigh for doing a great job in her first briefing,” Sanders wrote. “It’s one of the toughest but most rewarding parts of the job and she handled it with confidence and grace. Well done @PressSec!”Proud of my friend Kayleigh for doing a great job in her first briefing. It’s one of the toughest but most rewarding parts of the job and she handled it with confidence and grace. Well done @PressSec!— Sarah Huckabee Sanders (@SarahHuckabee) May 1, 2020McEnany “crushed it,” Jason Miller, Communications Director for the 2016 Trump campaign, said.He outlined all the ‘rules’ for Trump’s communications strategy – all of which she hit: “1) Tell the truth. 2) Don’t speculate. 3) Give [Trump] flexibility & don’t box him in. 4) Drive [Trump’s] positives even if question [sic] doesn’t allow for it. 5) Turn stupid questions back on the questioner. 6) Be likeable, stay cool!”",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/kayleigh-mcenany-is-a-class-act/
141,Commentary,Justice for General Flynn.,"Justice may finally be coming for Lt. General Michael Flynn.A complete and total exoneration, and a serious look at the depth of his prosecutor’s misconduct. This is according to new legal filings by Flynn’s relentless pitbull, patriot attorney, Sidney Powell.Lt. General Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in November of 2017. As part of his guilty plea, it was agreed upon that Flynn would cooperate fully with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The motive was clear from the start.The prosecution’s goal for General Flynn to flip on President Donald J. Trump, forcing some kind of “confession” vis-a-vis Russian collusion that didn’t exist. Perhaps Flynn could also flip on Trump for the obstruction of justice charge that then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe unilaterally opened.It isn’t unusual, nor illegal, for the FBI to coerce testimony out of a suspect in order to pursue a larger suspect. Of course, it’s usually reserved for making mobsters flip on their bosses.It was a particularly perverted use of the tactic to try to make an advisor flip on his President.It was never ethical, and that much was obvious. But now? We know it was never legal.Whenever the prosecution flips a defendant into a cooperating witness, they must be transparent with the court and other defendants on just how they enticed that person to cooperate. This is done to ensure due process in the courtroom.If a mobster is flipping on his boss in exchange for charges being dropped, the jury has to know that. It colors the motivations of the mobster, and should be part of the deliberations. This practice was solidified into law by the Giglio v. United States Supreme Court case.Flynn’s attorney, Sidney Powell, is alleging there was a secret deal between the prosecutor Brandon Van Grack and Flynn’s previous defense lawyers who worked at the Covington law firm. The contents of the deal were sickening in their lack of ethics, and made illegal by Grack’s lack of transparency with the court.After baselessly threatening to prosecute Michael Flynn’s son with a crime, Grack quietly told the Covington attorneys the Special Counsel’s Office (SCO) would decline to prosecute Flynn’s son, if Flynn himself pleaded guilty.He made sure never overtly commit to this, but the Covington attorneys understood exactly what was happening.In Exhibit 1 (below) of Powell’s supplement to dismiss, she reveals a largely redacted email correspondence between two attorneys at the Covington law firm. The unredacted portions of the email are damning for those who attempted to prosecute Lt. General Flynn.There is Robert Kelner of Covington, informing his colleague Stephen Anthony that they “have a lawyers’ unofficial understanding that they are unlikely to charge Junior in light of the cooperation agreement.”“Junior” is a reference to Michael G. Flynn, the son of Lt. General Michael T. Flynn.In case there was any doubt of just whom was being referenced by the Covington attorneys in Exhibit 1, Sidney Powell included Exhibit 2 (below). Exhibit 2 is another largely redacted correspondence between the two attorneys, which removes much of the doubt.Sidney Powell has been on a legal quest to get Lt. General Flynn’s case dismissed for egregious government misconduct. And what’s shown there—a blatant withholding of Giglio material from the court—is definitely an example of egregious government misconduct.Perhaps the most enticing line of the legal filing was when Sidney Powell revealed that the government advised her there was “more to come” in the realm of exculpatory evidence for Lt. General Flynn.This evidence is likely coming from the US Attorney in St. Louis: Jeffery Jensen, who was tapped by Attorney General William Barr to perform a review of the Flynn case. Evidently it was both necessary and fruitful, as it already produced a Giglio violation and a promise of more to come.We received a clue of what might be to come when Maria Bartiromo hosted Doug Colins for a segment on her Fox News show.During the segment, Maria said there are notes taken by James Baker about the meeting between FBI agents and Flynn conducted at the White House. The meeting in which Flynn allegedly lied to the FBI.According to Maria, these notes by the FBI’s former chief legal counsel say that the meeting was a “complete setup”, and that “Flynn never lied”.We should learn more about the destruction of Michael Flynn by the government he served honorably very soon.Maria Bartiromo had sources telling her that Michael T. Flynn would be exonerated within the week. For the sake of justice, we can only hope that her sources are completely right.",https://thenationalpulse.com/news/justice-for-general-flynn/
142,Commentary,Are We Living in the Fourth Turning?,"The Chinese coronavirus has demanded the full attention and resources of America and the world at large, resulting in a time of great instability and crisis. This time of great crisis looks an awful lot like William Strauss (1947-2007) and Neil Howe’s seasonal crisis period foretold in their book The Fourth Turning. For those not familiar with their work, the book demonstrates with compelling evidence that history, and particularly Anglo-American history, has occurred in cycles—or seasons.The writers predict, based upon the traceable “rhythms of modern history,” that “sometime before the year 2025, America will pass through a great gate in history, commensurate with the American Revolution, Civil War, and twin emergencies of the Great Depression and World War II.”The book, published in 1997, claims that “[h]istory is seasonal, and winter is coming.”This time of wintery crisis the authors label a Fourth Turning is not necessarily one event, but rather a period of time.An argument could be made that the current season of crisis began with September 11th, 2001, or even the 2008 economic crash.  These two events caused exponential instability in America and around the world, just as we are experiencing today.The effects of the virus have been unprecedented and have not been limited to the fields of health and medicine. The Chinese coronavirus has upended national and global matters such as travel, economics, supply chains, and geopolitics. The virus has required massive shutdowns and unprecedented economic relief. This has led many to compare our present reality with perilous times of seasons past.U.N. Secretary António Guterres warned that “[t]he current coronavirus outbreak is the biggest challenge for the world since World War Two,” as reported by BBC News.World War II just so happened to be America’s last Fourth Turning, according to Strauss and Howe. The point is bigger than merely marking the epoch in which this virus is occurring.Perhaps, as Strauss and Howe demonstrate, past and current seasons of history offer clues to where we, as a nation and a world, may be headed.According to the authors, a Fourth Turning leads to a time of renewal, or a “high,” just as winter leads to spring. The time which follows a crisis occurs “when a new civic order implants and the old values regime decays.”So while our country and others contend with the risks, questions, and fallout related to the virus, it is wise to acknowledge the potential for societal and global restructuring to be happening in the background.There is the potential for such shifts to come in both big and small ways.For instance, there is a growing trend against the use of traditional banknotes. This would enhance the possibility of future digital currencies—saying nothing about what will be left of the economies in which a potential digital currency would be used.Additionally, world powers are not sitting idle while most of the world is being told to stay at home.An Executive Summary released by the U.S. Department of State indicated concern that, “China may be conducting small nuclear tests in secret.”Additionally, Iran just launched a military satellite and the leadership situation within the North Korean dictatorship is, at present, uncertain. These and countless other reports highlight the reality for potential geopolitical disaster.The authors of The Fourth Turning point out that “[h]istory’s howling storms can bring out the worst and best in a society.”We may indeed be living in what Strauss and Howe refer to as a Fourth Turning. Whether or not this is true, one thing is for sure: we need 2020 vision.As the authors quote in preface to The Fourth Turning: “That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.” (Ecclesiastes 3:15)",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/are-we-living-in-the-fourth-turning/
143,Commentary,"CAIN: Trump’s Immigration Limits Are The Necessary, Bold Move to Restore Our Economy","President Trump’s common-sense order to restrict new immigration at a time when a pandemic has tens of millions of Americans out of work is undoubtedly pro-worker, but that doesn’t make it “anti-business.”There’s absolutely no risk of a labor shortage — quite the opposite — so there’s no need to import foreigners who would compete with Americans for jobs once the economy gets going again.More or less unprompted, journalists have begun using this “anti-business” canard to promote the idea that we need to keep importing new foreign workers at a time when more than 26 million Americans have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic.The facts, however, show that this is one case where the interests of workers and business owners are completely aligned.For one thing, the President’s order does not apply to categories of immigration that are designed to address specific business needs. Temporary farm workers, highly skilled “O” visas, the vaunted H-1B visa that the tech industry uses to bring in tens of thousands of workers every year, and even the J-1 visa for seasonal academic exchange programs are all unaffected. Businesses have gotten every exemption they need to carry on as normal.To the extent that immigration is restricted by the order, it mainly affects the issuance of green cards, which grant permanent residency status. In a normal year, America takes in hundreds of thousands of foreigners, the overwhelming majority of whom qualify solely because they have a relative already living here. Although they aren’t coming here on a work visa, most of them are still going to need jobs in order to meet the Trump administration’s enhanced self-sufficiency standards.Temporary immigration restrictions will undoubtedly benefit American workers as our country emerges from the economic shutdowns necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic.The opposing case is so flimsy that The New York Times resorted to citing fringe libertarian economic theory to claim that increasing the labor supply actually increases wages.It’s amazing how far The Times will go to attack a Trump policy. In less topsy-turvy times, the newspaper’s own Trump-hating economist, Paul Krugman, stated emphatically that “Immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants. That’s just supply and demand.”In an economy with 26 million people looking for work, the case for pausing the issuance of new green cards is so obvious and common-sense that liberals have had to twist themselves into knots to come up with criticisms. They did the same thing when President Trump declared that he had “total authority” over the pace of re-opening, suddenly becoming strident defenders of states’ rights after spending the better part of the last century concentrating power in the federal government.Come on — when’s the last time you heard a liberal complain about anything being “anti-business?” It’s so far outside their comfort zone that they clearly don’t comprehend their own arguments, because there’s nothing “anti-business” about the President’s temporary immigration restrictions.There are 26 million freshly out-of-work Americans in the labor pool right now, all of whom have recent on-the-job experience somewhere. Of all the problems business owners face right now, a labor shortage is not one of them.What businesses are going to need most as coronavirus-related restrictions are lifted is a ready supply of customers eager to spend — and that means getting those 26 million Americans back to their jobs as quickly as possible so they’ll have their regular incomes restored and start buying consumer goods that they haven’t been able to buy during the lockdown.When we do reopen the economy, workers and businesses will have to work cooperatively to get the economy back to full health. President Trump is making sure that they have the right incentives to do that.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/trump-immigration-limits-bold-economy/
144,Commentary,"BIZARRE: Harvard Prof Blasts ‘Authoritarian’ Homeschooling, Claims Government ‘Should Deny the Right’ of Parents","One of Harvard University’s faculty directors has lashed out at homeschooling, asserting the practice is “dangerous” and gives parents “authoritarian” control.In other words, Harvard comes out against parenting. Oh, and Christians, too. Naturally.Elizabeth Bartholet, a law professor and faculty director of the schools Child Advocacy Program at Harvard went so far as to claim the increasingly popular practice of homeschooling should be banned.Prof. Bartholet claims that it gives parents “authoritarian” control over their own children, noting that 90 percent of homeschoolers are driven by conservative, Christian beliefs and that the parents are “extreme religious ideologues” who question science and will seek to remove them from mainstream culture.In an 80-page document published by the Arizona Law Review, Bartholet spuriously addresses “the rapidly growing homeschooling phenomenon and the threat it poses to children and society”.Apparently, the Harvard professor believes free thinking individuals that worship God and disagree with establishment education focused on climate change, gender transitioning, open borders, and participation trophies are a danger to society.She writes: “States should impose significant restrictions on homeschooling,” adding: “[t]he new regime should deny the right to homeschool, subject to carefully delineated exceptions for situations in which homeschooling is needed and appropriate. Parents should have a significant burden of justification for a requested exception. There is no other way to ensure that children receive an education or protection against maltreatment at all comparable to that provided to public school children.”The belief that the government can raise a child better than the parents is arguably the more acute danger, and one that shouldn’t be overlooked.Michael Donnelly, senior council for the Home School Legal Defense Association called her views “extreme” and explained that calling “American homeschooling parents too ignorant or too religious goes against the weight of decades of scholarly research on homeschooling which demonstrates positive academic, civic, and social outcomes”.Statistics prove students who are homeschooled graduate college at a higher rate than their peers – 66.7 percent compared to 57.5 percent – and earn higher grade point averages.Not too bad for a bunch of conservative Christians with a set of deep religious beliefs and core family values. Or did she mean “basket of deplorables”?This scrutiny couldn’t have come at a worse time for the university.The institution is currently under the microscope of both the country and the President for attempting to secure $9 million from the Cares Act while receiving inordinate amounts in endowments: in excess of $40 million dollars.When asked about the handout at a recent press briefing,  President Trump responded: “They shouldn’t have taken it”.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/bizarre-harvard-prof-blasts-home-schooling-as-authoritarian/
145,Commentary,"Transgender Surgeries Now Deemed ‘Non-Essential’. They Should Be, Forever.","The novel coronavirus has forced doctors across the country to halt elective procedures, including many transgender reassignment surgeries. However, some studies suggest these surgeries may not ever be essential. In the 1960s, John’s Hopkins University pioneered the sex-reassignment surgery. Outpatient studies conducted in the 1970s found that, while most of the post-surgery patients described themselves as “satisfied” by the results, the treated patients showed no psycho-social improvements. Dr. Paul McHugh, psychiatrist-in-chief at John’s Hopkins Hospital at the time, eventually discontinued the procedures citing the unfavorable outpatient data.Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder.– Dr. McHugh, Wall St. Journal, 2014To Dr. McHugh, producing a satisfied yet still distressed patient did not justify surgically amputating healthy, functioning organs. Though genital reconstruction and hormone therapies offer a means of partial transition from one gender to another, a true elective sex-change remains biologically impossible (barring extremely abnormal genetic mutations). According to Dr. McHugh, “People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women.”Innate neurological barriers to sex-reassignment surgery ensure its inevitable incompletion. Neurologists find the female brain and male brain maintain distinct characteristics throughout life. For instance, male brains utilize seven times more grey matter, areas of the brain that localize information and action. Female brains, on the other hand, produce nearly ten times more white matter, which connects the brain’s processing centers. These biological differences manifest in evolutionary distinctions between the two sexes. For example, females tend to be great multi-taskers while men thrive in single, task-focused environments. Even in the womb, the brain of a male fetus differs greatly from that of a female. Dr. Gregory L. Jantz points out that during prenatal development, “females tend to have verbal centers on both sides of the brain, while males tend to have verbal centers on only the left hemisphere.” Dr. Ruben Gur, neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, believes this difference relates to females’ ability to express emotion and feeling more effectively than their male counterparts. According to Dr. Gur, “Most of these differences are complementary. They increase the chances of males and females joining together. It helps the whole species.”In addition to the neurological differences between men women, the karyotype displaying a person’s sex chromosomes – XX for females and XY for males – cannot surgically be altered. In short, these biological variances make a full sex change unattainable. Nonetheless, the progressive left demands citizens discount basic biological definitions of sex in order to protect an individual’s subjective sense of their true self – often to the detriment of those they seek to help.Graduate studies at the University of California Los Angeles document a 40 percent suicide rate among transgendered individuals, shockingly higher than the national average. Dr. McHugh believes that “the high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.” Perhaps the novel coronavirus’ suspension of transgender reassignment surgeries will provide the medical community an opportunity to consider the downsides of these procedures.

146,Commentary,"Justin Amash – the Anti-Trump, Libertarian Candidate for President – Needs to Sit Down.","Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI) is considering a third party Presidential run, and it’s one of the dumbest things we’ve heard since CNN’s Brian Stelter began to hype now-convicted felon Michael Avenatti for the job.Elected to the House of Representatives in 2010, libertarian Amash made headlines for his opposition to the far-left excesses of the Obama Administration. While he helped found the important House Freedom Caucus, Donald Trump’s election in 2016 appears to have driven Amash off the deep end.“…he wants to have attention,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy explained last year as Amash backed impeachment for what we all now know as the “Russia hoax”.Fooled by the media and co-opted by flawed intelligence agency behavior (read: FISA abuses), for a so-called libertarian, Amash sure did seem to buy the administrative state line.Months later, as Amash finally took the hint and dropped from the Republican Party, President Trump tweeted:“Great news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest & most disloyal men in Congress is “quitting” the Party. No Collusion, No Obstruction! Knew he couldn’t get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat. A total loser!”Nothing President Trump said was untrue.Amash attacked fellow Republicans because President Trump dared to take on the Chinese Communist Party with tariffs.Given the latest public polling on China, the Michigan Congressman might want to keep his mouth shut about the matter if he does indeed run for president.His stance has often looked less ideological and more self-serving.Congressman Amash and his operate a family business called Tekton Tools, which claims its products are made in the USA. Local media reported that tools sold by Tekton are in fact manufactured in China.He was also the only Republican to vote against President Trump’s emergency declaration for border wall funding, despite claiming to support border wall and immigration enforcement.Congressman Amash’s hatred for the president has made him friends in the NeverTrump right as well as the anti-Trump left.These new friends have been urging Amash to run a spoiler campaign for president, probably on the Libertarian Party ticket. They’d be welcome to him.Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson got 3.3 percent of the popular vote in 2020, and Libertarians are hoping for more from Amash. Perhaps this candidate will know where Aleppo is.Such a campaign would likely be counterproductive to the cause of liberty – if Amash cares about it.In his attempt to hurt Trump, the 40-year-old Michigander would only be helping Joe Biden and a Democratic Party working harder than ever to curtail American freedoms.Libertarians like to pretend there are absolutely no differences between the Democratic Party and the GOP.“Replacing one elderly, not-quite-all-there guy with a different elderly, not-quite-all-there-guy — I’m not feeling it,” said Libertarian Party chairman Nicholas Sarwark.Imagine university-style speech codes in common life, Canadian-style healthcare, California-style regulation.Imagine the hyperinflation from a universal income scheme, no more border enforcement, and prosecution for using the wrong pronouns.If that’s the future Justin Amash desires, he should come out and say so. Otherwise, he should sit back down.Vinny Ungro contributed to this article",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/justin-amash-needs-to-sit-down/
147,Commentary,Coronavirus Pandemic Shows FCC Got It Right on ‘Net Neutrality’,"Can our healthcare system manage the strain of potentially millions of sick patients? How will our economy cope with stay-at-home orders and millions of jobs lost? And what about our network capacity? Will an unprecedented surge in Internet use — especially with a newfound dependence on streaming video via conferencing services like Zoom — cause widespread congestion that might limit the ability of public health and safety professionals to do their jobs?COVID-19 has in many ways provided a test case to determine whether the FCC’s Restoring Internet Freedom (RIF) order is helpful or harmful to public safety. The controversial order — which made FCC Chairman Ajit Pai a household name — reversed the Obama-era Title II framework (more commonly known as “net neutrality”) and prompted a tsunami of apocalyptic predictions that the Internet would be destroyed forever. Obviously that didn’t happen. And in truth, not only have web users gotten along just fine since the FCC implemented its RIF order, but the end of net neutrality has also made life amid the pandemic much easier.Consider the evidence.Although still early, there have been few, if any, reports of network congestion during this crisis. Instead, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have worked alongside federal agencies pledging commitments to keep Americans connected. Additionally, the ISPs have adopted network management practices that prioritize service to public health professionals and law enforcement personnel while at the same time delivering unimpeded service to the rest of Americans. Millions of workers have been able to telework without issue.Religious Americans have been able to participate in services from their homes. And streaming services like Disney Plus have been able to deliver their product uninterrupted for satisfied customers — as shown by their higher subscription rates. Those who advocated for net neutrality — and against the FCC’s RIF order — warned that ISPs if left to their own devices would throttle speeds and weaken service for consumers. They also suggested that public safety would be put at risk. None of that has happened. In fact, the FCC’s “light touch” approach has allowed ISPs to innovate and compete, creating a better network for both consumers and public safety users. Not only have ISPs in the US embraced a strong commitment to promoting public safety, but they are also doing so in a way that far exceeds the performance of ISPs in other countries under regulatory regimes similar to the “net neutrality” framework.Consider what is happening in Europe, where streaming services like YouTube and Netflix are being forced to reduce video quality in order to help ease stress on their network infrastructure. That’s not happening here in the United States. While Italy’s first responders are depending on the same service that Netflix is, due to Europe’s so-called “net neutrality” rules, first responders in the U.S. are enjoying the “fastest lane” while everyone else in America still gets high-speed access with little to no interruption. That’s what happens when you allow ISPs to innovate and solve problems, rather than force them to spend all their effort trying to adhere to bureaucratic rules that often don’t address the problem at hand.Instead of going back to a heavy-handed approach that treats the Internet like a slow-moving public utility, we should recognize what is happening before our eyes: the FCC’s “light touch” regulatory framework has enabled our ISPs to innovate and flourish so that they can deliver the best product to consumers. And the FCC’s decision to pivot to this approach, which faced enormous political pushback from the Left, looks even better in retrospect. If the FCC had maintained net neutrality, there’s no telling what kinds of network issues would have been faced during this pandemic by our public safety professionals and by millions of working Americans across the country.

148,Commentary,"FACT CHECK: Tom Cotton Didn’t Spread a ‘Conspiracy Theory’, But the Media Used CCP Propaganda to Attack Him Anyway","There is new, increasing, and compelling evidence to suggest the novel coronavirus did not originate from the infamous wet market in Wuhan, but rather was the result of “safety and management weaknesses at the WIV (Wuhan Institute of Virology) lab.”While developments don’t yet confirm the theory dismissed early on as “conspiracy,” it suggests details shared most notably by Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) are by no means outlandish.“This virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market.” Sen. Cotton told Fox News’s Maria Bartiromo.And while Twitter accounts like those of the popular ZeroHedge website were banned for suggesting the official Chinese Communist Party line was fraudulent, it behoves us to recall who has been at the cutting on the subject.A February 17 New York Times article by Alexandra Stevenson was titled: “Senator Tom Cotton Repeats Fringe Theory of Coronavirus Origins.”The article alleges, “The conspiracy theory lacks evidence and has been dismissed by scientists. But it has gained an audience with the help of well-connected critics of the Chinese government such as Stephen K. Bannon.” Stevenson claimed, without evidence, that “…right-wing media outlets fan the anger. Beijing, with its heavy-handed censorship and stranglehold on information, unwittingly gives the conspiracy theories a boost.”Stevenson is right about one thing: heavy censorship and hiding information creates an environment that is conducive to the spread conspiracy theories. However, by not even asking basic questions, The NYT once again ends up with its hand in the cookie jar.Yahoo! News put out a video describing Cotton’s theory as debunked. On the clip, one caption reads: “The claim, making its rounds in right-wing publications and on the internet, suggests that the virus may have started as an unleashed biological weapon”. The video then quotes from Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador to the United States, condemning Sen. Cotton’s statements as dangerous, and likely to “fan up racial discrimination and xenophobia.”But Cotton did not insinuate that the virus was man-made. He called for questions to be answered. Something the Chinese Communist Party has so far refused to do, with the assistance of the World Health Organization running public relations interference for them.The Chinese ambassador’s comments were made on CBS’ Face The Nation: one of the countless examples of news outlets propping up Chinese officials to spread their propaganda.The Washington Post originally took a similar angle to Yahoo! News, enlisting an expert to “debunk” Cotton’s claim that the virus may have originated in the WIV.Richard Ebright, the expert that the Washington Post Enlisted, dismissed that the virus was “engineered”, again a claim never made by Cotton, but one which the media appears to want to pin to him.NEW: Richard Ebright, molecular biologist quoted by @washingtonpost to rebut theory that the virus was a bioweapon, tells @AndrewKerrNC COVID-19 may have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology https://t.co/crGU2sfEES— Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) April 3, 2020WaPo conveniently buried where Ebright concurred with Cotton about the possibility of the virus being a result of malfeasance. It wouldn’t be a good look if your chosen expert was also a conspiracy theorist, would it?MSNBC may have the most egg on its face over this situation. A February 17 article made the same assertions as the Washington Post, dishonestly pinning the theory that the virus was man-made on Cotton, and citing Ebright’s claim that this was impossible (while also omitting the part where Ebright agreed with Cotton on the possible origin).The difference with this piece is that the author went wider: attacking the entire Republican Party as conspiracy theorists. “There are some prominent political figures in the nation’s capital who seem a little too fond of conspiracy theories. Folks like Donald Trump and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) routinely seem to embrace some rather nutty explanations for events with more rational explanations. But let’s not forget Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who occasionally embraces some doozies of his own.”MSNBC continues bashing Cotton and other Republicans for dabbling in “conspiracy theories”. The article presents a false premise, then used it to attack an entire party by using other examples such as Cotton worrying about the use of the U.S. southern border for terrorism, or for calling out the Kavanaugh-Christine Blasey Ford hoax.Speaking of “doozies”.More recent reports stating that was long-standing concern about safety and management practices at the lab doesn’t prove anything, but it is compelling evidence that Cotton, Bannon, and other proponents of this theory have been further vindicated, at least in terms of their ideas being labeled as “conspiracy theories.”Sen. Cotton is right that the Chinese government has to be held responsible, at least for their unwillingness to be truthful and transparent with the rest of the world.

149,Commentary,Beware the Russian Disinformation Trope.,"Last week, the DOJ declassified three footnotes in the Inspector General’s FISA report. They showed the FBI knew Christopher Steele had associations with shady Russian oligarchs and that somebody — whose identity is redacted — suggested in 2017 that parts of the dossier may have included Russian disinformation.Some responded as if the footnotes revealed Vladimir Putin and not an FBI-CIA-Clinton conspiracy was responsible for the ridiculous machinations of Russiagate. National Review editor Rich Lowry was especially over-the-top, even managing by passive-aggressive link to turn the disclosures into a criticism of President Trump:In other words, the Kremlin may have succeeded in getting us to turn even more viciously against ourselves and conduct our politics in an atmosphere characterized by screaming headlines, dark insinuations and endless investigations — all by feeding a few lies to a private eye hired by the Hillary Clinton campaign to dig up dirt on Trump.Let’s unwind that.We already knew that something happened a few months after the election that made the FBI stop using the dossier to get FISA warrants. By then the British had come clean and were discrediting Steele. Maybe it was British spies saying, “Have you idiots considered yet whether this is Russian disinformation?” Anyone with half a brain would have asked the question.That would explain why the identity of the dossier skeptic in the footnotes is blacked out. Under the Five Eyes Agreement, details about British intelligence sharing cannot be disclosed. The second footnote (#350) says that whomever the undisclosed dossier skeptic is, he or she has “no information” tying its salacious allegations to Russia. It is just speculation, in other words.Did Russia fabricate the Steele dossier with the intent of getting us to turn viciously on ourselves?It is theoretically possible that Vladimir Putin fed a whopper to Christopher Steele about Donald Trump hiring prostitutes to pee on a bed the Obamas had once used. There are two problems with that scenario, though. First, Steele had not been to Russia for 20 years. He spent his professional life as an anti-Russia gadfly. Fatuous claims are made on his behalf that Putin had ordered him to be poisoned. If Christopher Steele is the ex-spy our vaunted intelligence services relied on to explore whether Putin had kompromat on Trump – that’s really bad.The bigger problem with any Russian disinformation scenario is for the dossier to affect the succession of power in America even slightly, the FBI would have to make 17 separate sloppy mistakes, all inuring to the benefit of Hillary Clinton and against Trump. Unless his name was Ras-Putin, there is no way Putin could have divined that such a wild story would be treated with a seriousness it never deserved. As I have asked on this page before: “If the Steele dossier tapped Russian sources to reveal a Putin plot to harm Hillary, why did it primarily include crazy stuff that hurt Trump? And if it was created to smear Trump, why did the intelligence community rely on it to conclude that Putin was out to get Hillary?”CBS reporter Catherine Herridge may have provided some answers this week when she uncovered two additional declassified footnotes from the report. These revealed, not surprisingly, that US spy agencies contorted themselves in 2017 to conclude that Steele was somehow connected to Russian intelligence, but he wasn’t compromised by them. What a tangled web our spies weaved, huh? We already knew they were trying to sell the idea of kompromat, though. Indeed – by definition – it’s not kompromat if it’s not from Putin. More interesting in the notes was the admission that the FBI knew a Steele sub-source favored Hillary Clinton.  As those of us chided as conspiracy theorists have been saying for years, they were the only kinds of sub-sources Clinton opposition researcher Fusion GPS used. Most importantly, the footnotes reveal dubious intelligence assessments based on unidentified but compromised second and third-hand sources, and no real evidence of a Russian disinformation campaign. Okay, let’s assume – even with all that –  it was the Russians. If so, they were just messing with someone they hated (Christopher Steele) and probably thought if he repeated the pee tape stupidity it would only make him look like an idiot. Read closely, though, the dossier tells you who fabricated it beginning on its first page, and it was not the Russians:Source B asserted that the TRUMP operation was both supported and directed by Russian President Vladimir PUTIN.  Its aim was to sow discord and disunity within the US itself, but more especially within the Transatlantic alliance which was viewed as inimical to Russia’s interests.  Source C, a senior Russian financial official said that the TRUMP operation should be seen in terms of PUTIN’s desire to return to Nineteenth Century ‘Great Power’ politics anchored upon countries’ interests rather than ideals-based international order established after World War Two. S/he had heard PUTIN talking in this way to close associates on several occasions.Unless Vladimir Putin goes around the Kremlin talking like an Ivy League graduate with a plush job waiting for him as an analyst at John Brennan’s CIA, he never said any of those things. An ideals-based Transatlantic alliance that defies the rabble who prefer governance based on national interest is, instead, a uniquely Western worldview. Nobody has produced evidence that Source C was acting at the behest of the Russian government. Instead, he or she is parroting official Washington’s psycho-fantasies about the world. A good guess is that it was either a complete fabrication or a self-serving oligarch buying a favor by telling the Clinton campaign what it wanted to hear, who would later strongly deny any involvement. Even before the footnotes were released everyone knew Steele had connections with such characters. Lee Smith, the venerable, readable, oracle of Spygate is right: the dossier is a political operation sourced in Washington and any other interpretation is just a distraction. Beware especially pundits associated with NeverTrump who assert with ontological certainty that Russia interfered in the election. They would love to believe that when people in Pittsburgh defied them and voted for Trump, we were tricked by Putin.The problem with their self-serving ruse is that “Putin-did-it” provides a lifeboat for the Spygate conspirators. Brennan, Comey, McCabe et al. are going to say, “we were fooled by the Russians like everyone else.” In the hysteria they generated, Putin is the matinee villain du jour and Russian disinformation makes them victims of his shenanigans, poor fellas.Three years of scrutiny has determined that the dossier was phony. That the FBI, CIA and Clinton campaign used it to orchestrate the biggest political dirty trick in American history is the real scandal, and Putin is a red herring.Image from www.shopcatalog.com ",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/beware-the-russian-disinformation-trope/
150,Commentary,Police Send Lawyer to Psychiatric Facility Following Anti-Lockdown Advocacy,"Police in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg took a lawyer to a psychiatric institution “against her will” where she spent several days following her advocacy against coronavirus-related lockdown measures.Beate Bahner was taken into the facility on Easter Sunday, having asked onlookers to call local police. Bahner is sid to have feared for her own safety, according to German-language media reports, due to her increased profile amidst her anti-lockdown activity.The lawyer – pejoratively referred to as “coronoia” (a play on “coronavirus” and “paranoia”) – originally reported that police manhandled her upon her arrest, causing her to hit her head.They then took her to a local psychiatric institution where she was held until Tuesday.Following her release, Bahner’s story was altered, and she subsequently admits to having been drinking with friends and falling off a bicycle.The incident has caused further consternation amongst those who claim Germany’s reaction to the coronavirus has been excessive.Local news reports are replete with stories of protests, demonstrations, and exasperation about the situation in the European country. German skeptics tell the National Pulse that the measures are draconian, and more of a reflection of a centralized appetite to use the coronavirus crisis to mask national economic failures.Germany’s economy has been teetering on the precipice of recession for the past year.Bahner – a medical lawyer of 25 years and author of five books – wrote a letter on April 3rd announcing a lawsuit against “[T]he measures taken by the federal and state governments,” calling them, “blatantly unconstitutional and [in violation of] a multitude of fundamental rights of citizens in Germany to an extent never seen before.”She concluded in her letter: “This shutdown must be ended immediately!”Her case was rejected, and she wrote: “unfortunately [I have] not succeeded in… saving the liberal-democratic basic order in Germany… from the worst global attack and the lightning-fast establishment of the most inhuman tyranny the world has ever seen.”Bahner is said to have called for a mass demonstration against lockdown measures on Easter Saturday.While she remains under investigation for assault and “resistance to law enforcement officers,” Bahner also led up to 200 demonstrators on Wednesday April 15th, outside a police building in Heidelberg.Bahner and her supporters are said to have hugged each other in response to social distancing demands by authorities. Police used megaphones to attempt to convince the crowd to disperse.VIDEO: The news follows the police dispersal of protesters in North Carolina in the United States this week.According to local news reports: More than 100 protesters rallied in downtown Raleigh to reopen North Carolina on Tuesday, describing Gov. Roy Cooper’s stay-home order as an unconstitutional overreach that will kill the state’s small businesses.At least one protester, Monica Faith Ussery, 51, of Holly Springs, was charged with violating the executive order.“I have a right to peacefully assemble,” she said as officers led her away, her hands bound with a zip tie. “God bless America.”…The protest was organized by ReopenNC, a private Facebook group organized last week that wants people to make their own stay-at-home decisions to avoid exposure to COVID-19 as the worldwide pandemic continues. The group surpassed 28,000 members on Tuesday afternoon.Social media invitations are circulating for similar protests in New York State.The National Pulse has seen one such invitation (below) encouraging a “Peaceful Open-Up Walk Down 5th Ave” scheduled for Saturday, April 18th.“We are ready to take our chance with CV-19,” the invite says, adding: “This is a peaceful walk to encourage our local, state, and federal elected officials to open the economy.”Editor’s Note: The National Pulse does not believe in preemptively exposing the general public to potential infection and urges readers to adhere to national and local guidelines. We continue to support President Trump’s #30DaysToSlowTheSpread plan.

151,Commentary,Divest. From. China.,"Since 1980, the United States has granted “Most Favored Nation” trading status to China on the condition that they improve their record on human rights as well as play fair regarding international commerce. Despite not living up to those conditions, every president since has granted a waiver maintaining the status for another year, sometimes against the advice of Congress.Presidents Bush and Clinton both supported normalized trade relations with China.“Will we do more to advance the cause of human rights if China is isolated?” Clinton asked in 1994, suggesting that opening trade would encourage more liberalization and freedom in the Middle Kingdom.President Clinton urged Congress to grant permanent trade status to China throughout his presidency. Congress finally agreed in 2000, and President George W. Bush signed the law the following year.Thus began an audacious experiment to change China through trade and openness. Unfortunately, twenty years of hindsight shows it to be a miserable failure.Rather than allowing China to adopt the best of Western culture, open trade has instead brought the worst of China – the gangster political ruling class – to the West.Corporations such as Apple and Google have invested heavily in China, taking advantage of cheap manufacturing as well as for access to the largest developing market on earth.Hollywood and the NBA have also become dependent on the Chinese economy.For all their talk of social justice, cash is still king. While American companies have no problem criticizing US government policies, they tread carefully around China’s record of abuse for fear of losing access to such a lucrative market.Normalized trade has not had the desired effect on the Chinese government.More than three decades after the Tiananmen Square massacre, China is still being accused of some of the most horrific crimes against humanity, from the deliberate genocide of Muslim Uighurs to harvesting organs from political prisoners.What have American citizens gained from this trade relationship? Sure, we’ve got some cheap goods and electronics. But at what cost?Since normalizing trade, China has stolen millions of manufacturing jobs while flooding our cities and towns with deadly drugs such as fentanyl. They have shamelessly copied our intellectual property, hacked our corporate and government computer networks, and have now unleashed a global outbreak that has killed thousands and brought our economy to a standstill.Donald Trump has been urging America to divest from China for a long time.As a businessman, he saw the danger of relying too much on a belligerent regime. As President, he has used tariffs to level the playing field and to urge American companies to bring manufacturing back to our country. The coronavirus pandemic should be the final nail in the coffin of Chinese entanglement: It is time to decouple.Japan is taking the lead on divestment, with their government pledging more than $2 billion to help their companies move their manufacturing away from China. Japan was particularly hard-hit when the pandemic shut down Chinese manufacturing, and Japanese leaders want to avoid being in such a vulnerable position again.Germany, worried about Chinese firms buying up domestic companies facing bankruptcy, strengthened its foreign investment law to prevent hostile takeovers by China or any other nation.“We in Germany and Europe need to have our own competencies and technologies in certain areas,” said economic minister Peter Altmaier.Even the US Department of Justice (DOJ) recognizes the necessity of decoupling from China.This week the DOJ urged the FCC to revoke the license of a Chinese government owned company that provides telecommunications services in the United States.“Today, more than ever, the life of the nation and its people runs on our telecommunications networks,” explained John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security. “Today’s action is but our next step in ensuring the integrity of America’s telecommunications systems.”The American people are starting to demand decoupling from China.Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has introduced bills to return manufacturing to our country, recently signal-boosted a suggestion that Amazon give customers the ability to filter out products that are made in China.Best new idea I’ve heard all day. What about it, @amazon @JeffBezos? https://t.co/QQp33aRyoh— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) April 9, 2020Cheap consumer products have simply not been worth the cost we continue to pay, every day.If given the opportunity, many Americans will gladly follow President Trump’s advice to “buy American and hire American”.It is time we rectify the mistake we made more than twenty years ago and finally end our abusive relationship with China.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/divest-from-china/
152,Commentary,New Zealand Politicians Take 20% Pay Cut While U.S. Congress Hands Itself $25M Extra,"New Zealand’s politicians are taking a pay cut in solidarity with those suffering the economic ramifications of coronavirus. U.S. politicians could learn something here.New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, is making ministers in her government and public service chief executives take a 20 percent pay cut for six months due to the impact on their economy.“This is where we can take action and that is why we have,” the Prime Minister added to her statement.“We acknowledge New Zealanders who are reliant on wage subsidies, taking a pay cut and losing their jobs as a result of the global pandemic.”President Trump already gives away his salary. Meanwhile Democrats have focused on funding for the arts, green new deals, diversity programs, funding for Planned Parenthood, and mail-in voting.The U.S. House of Representatives is now working on a part-time basis yet wants full-time benefits.A spokesman for the House Appropriations Committee revealed that at this time of belt-tightening, Congress snuck in $25 million of extra funding for itself:“The funding is to support the House’s capability to telework, including for the purchase of equipment and improvements to the network,” Evan Hollander told us in an email. “It will also provide for reimbursement costs for the staff of the House Child Care Center and covers the costs of the House food service contracts. In addition, it will support the Sergeant-At-Arms on continuity of operations matters.”Try asking your boss for the same deal.Many companies reduced or furloughed their employees during the virus affecting many Americans, yet Pelosi chooses not to lead by example. New Zealand’s leaders lead by taking a pay cut.And let’s not forget what Pelosi said about Congress taking a pay cut in 2013:“I don’t think we should do it… I think it is necessary for us to have the dignity of the job that we have rewarded.”Congress has a base salary of $174,000 a year, more than 3x the median household earns.Not a bad gig considering they work roughly 174 days in a year, equivalent to a thousand dollars a day and a pension plan that guarantees them up to 80 percent of their base salaries. Lifetime congressional workers like Pelosi earn over $230,000 per year.On top of the pay come the perks of the job. They receive a wide selection of health benefits, some of the best plans in the country (and keep them for life), and allowances of over $994,000 for expenses such as travel, office equipment, office rentals, supplies, and free airport parking in D.C. to name a few.If American politicians can’t show some solidarity with the public at the most heinous times, why do we expect them to represent us well when the sun is shining?",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/new-zealand-pay-cut-congress-25m/
153,Commentary,"Biden Said ‘China’s Rise Isn’t Our Demise’… Now 23,000 Americans Are Dead.","Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed in an op-ed for the New York Times: “China’s Rise Isn’t Our Demise.” Now, with nearly 23,000 Americans dead following the attempted Chinese Communist Party cover-up of the coronavirus, it’s time to look back at the would-be president’s claim.In the 2011 op-ed, Biden wrote: “I remain convinced that a successful China can make our country more prosperous, not less,” and concluded, “Some may warn of America’s demise, but I’m not among them. And let me reassure you: based on my time in China, neither are the Chinese.”Over the decade prior to that claim – 2001 to 2011 – the United States lost 2.7 million jobs to China, partly because of Chinese currency manipulation.Courted by cheap labor and low production costs, U.S. CEOs – like heads of the auto industry – increasingly moved their manufacturing companies overseas. By 2010, China passed the United States as the world’s top car market. The gradual dominance of American industry also benefitted from routine intellectual property theft. In 2019, one in five U.S. corporations reported that China’s companies had stolen their intellectual property within the last year. This year, the FBI finally named China as “the biggest law enforcement threat to the United States.” According to bureau director Christopher Wray, “The FBI has about 1,000 investigations involving China’s attempted theft of US-based technology in all 56 of our field offices and spanning just about every industry sector.” William Evanina, director of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center, believes that Chinese theft as it pertains to American trade secrets cost the United States “anywhere from $300bn to $600bn” every year.While American workers saw their wages plummet and their jobs shipped overseas to China, Wall Street corporatists prospered. Take the former Vice President’s son, Hunter Biden. Hunter is one of nine directors at BHR partners, a firm controlled by Chinese government-owned entities. According to reports, “over the past roughly six years, [BHR Partners] has channeled $2.5 billion or more on behalf of its financial backers into automotive, energy, mining and technology deals.” In 2015, BHR joined a $600 million takeover of Henniges Automotive, a Michigan-based automotive industry company, and secured a 49 percent stake as a result of the deal.Despite the Chinese blow to American industry at the expense of working-class people, Vice President Joe Biden continued to applaud government-led Chinese manufacturing.At the Export Import Bank conference in Washington in April of 2013, Biden said: “We have to update the global rules of the road. We have to do it in a way that maximize benefits for everyone, because obviously, it’s overwhelmingly in our interest, this is not a zero-sum game, it’s overwhelmingly in our interest that China prosper.” U.S. Attorney General William Barr disagrees. In his keynote address at the Department of Justice’s China Initiative Conference in 2018, Barr said: “For China, success is a zero-sum game.” He then announced the Justice Department’s China Initiative, “to confront China’s malign behaviors and protect U.S. technology.” According to Barr, the People’s Republic of China “employs a multi-pronged approach: engaging in cyber intrusions, co-opting private sector insiders through its intelligence services, and using non-traditional collectors, such as graduate students participating in university research projects.”The same year Vice President Joe Biden penned his “China’s Rise Isn’t Our Demise” opinion piece for the NYT, Donald Trump – a private citizen at the time – tweeted: “Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy, not a friend.”The novel coronavirus has made it clear that Biden’s history of praise for Chinese Communist Party certainly does not stand the test of time.

154,Commentary,Joe Biden’s (Anti) Climax.,"What an anti-climax!A race that began with roughly two dozen candidates – gripping the news cycle for well over a year – ended with a whimper as the nation remains laser-focused on the coronavirus crisis.Senator Bernie Sanders announced the suspension of his campaign in a video message to supporters Wednesday. The story barely registered on the websites of major news outlets. It was scantly covered on television.The race really began the moment Donald Trump won the presidency in the early hours of November 9, 2016. It began formally in January 2019 as major candidates began entering the race.The entries of “rising stars” like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker excited Democrat voters, as did those of liberal stalwart Elizabeth Warren and socialist icon Bernie Sanders. But all along, it was former Vice President Biden’s race to lose.Biden led the RealClearPolitics average of polls from the beginning, holding the lead except for one single day in October 2019, and a period of four weeks in February 2020. He was never anyone’s favorite candidate, but the aura of inevitability surrounding him was difficult for the other candidates to break through.That isn’t to say Biden wasn’t threatened.The race quickly became a mirror of the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, when the frontrunner Mitt Romney faced a rotating cast of candidates who, one at a time, rose to challenge him before fading out.Harris sent an early scare through the Biden camp in a memorable moment in the very first debate where she challenged Biden’s record on civil rights with a compelling personal story. She briefly jumped in the polls, but couldn’t sustain the momentum.Elizabeth Warren emerged as a “more electable” alternative to Sanders, and was the first one to overtake Biden in the polls. She then unveiled a detailed plan for Medicare for All, involving a massive expansion of government at an optimistic price tag of $21 trillion over 10 years. Once voters had to face the hard details of this leftist pipe dream dream, they rejected it, and Warren cratered.Then there was the surprising rise of Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old from a small city in Indiana. The favored candidate of Wall Street and Silicon Valley. When voting finally started, Buttigieg placed first in the Iowa delegate count, in a caucus that was botched by the party. Mayor Pete then tied first in New Hampshire with Senator Sanders, causing Biden to literally flee the state.A twist came with the highly-anticipated arrival of Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire who made a late entry into the race and spent a staggering sum of his own money to force his way onto the debate stage in February. But Liz Warren almost singlehandedly ended his campaign by confronting him over accusations of sexual harassment, for which the billionaire candidate appeared woefully unprepared.Meanwhile, Biden lost Nevada, and the man who dominated the race since before he entered it appeared dead in the water.Sanders – the most credible threat to Biden’s favored status – swept the popular vote in the first three states and appeared well on his way to the nomination.Then came South Carolina, which Biden had called his “firewall”. It worked.Biden sailed to an easy victory with nearly 50 percent of the vote. It was not a surprising result, but it was finally a shot in the arm to the Biden campaign: He had a pulse. And on Super Tuesday, Biden romped his way to 10 first-place finishes in 15 contests.Then, the remarkable.Nearly the entire Democrat Party cleared the field for Biden in order to stop Sanders. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar ended campaigns that still had life in order to endorse Biden. Former rivals like Kamala Harris and Beto O’Rourke came out of the woodwork to do their part and endorse him. Bloomberg – after spending $935 million of his own money only to win four delegates in American Samoa – pledged his fortune to Biden.Just like 2012, when Rick Santorum fought his way into a two-man race against Mitt Romney, Sanders was the last man standing against the frontrunner Biden.The Democrat Party united under one banner, and it wasn’t “We Want Joe” – it was “Stop Bernie Sanders”.Things got worse for Senator Sanders a week later when Michigan, which had delivered a key victory for him in the 2016 primary, went handily for Biden.The coronavirus panic sent the country into virtual lockdown, and Sanders could no longer rely on the big rallies that fueled his rise to keep up whatever energy his campaign had left. Sanders held his own against Biden in an interesting two-man debate with no live audience, but it didn’t change the dynamic of the race. Biden swept Florida, Illinois, and Arizona, giving him victories in eight of the 10 states that went to the polls after the other Democrats cleared the field for him.Sanders’s last stand was Wisconsin, which moved forward with a chaotic primary amid the coronavirus lockdown on Tuesday. Sanders had won the state handily in 2016. Results from Wisconsin have not even been released yet, but the Sanders campaign’s internal data must have shown that it was the final nail in the coffin.And so here we stand, with the 77-year-old Biden having outlasted all comers and clinched the nomination in unprecedented circumstances.Questions remain about Biden’s mental state, and there always remains the possibility that convention delegates will conspire in Milwaukee this summer to depose him in favor of someone else. Biden is not really anyone’s favorite candidate, and he will surely struggle to shore up the Democrat base behind him. But for now, the 2020 presidential election is set: Trump vs. Biden.What a bizarre finish.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/joe-bidens-anti-climax/
155,Commentary,Will Mel Gibson’s Passion of the Christ Sequel Be the ‘Biggest Film in History’?,"In February 2004, the controversial film, The Passion of the Christ, co-written, co-produced and directed by Mel Gibson for his company, Icon Productions, was released to enormous acclaim. Church groups throughout the country bought out theaters to see it in groups. Religious leaders debated whether it had an anti-Semitic overtone, for blaming the Jewish rabbis in the film for Jesus’s death. It became one of the most popular and celebrated independent films of all time and the highest-grossing R-rated film until the release of Deadpool (2016). The film was banned in Kuwait and Bahrain, because the religion of Islam forbids the visual depiction of prophets, and in Islam Jesus is considered a prophet. In Malaysia, only Christians were allowed to see it, and only Christian churches were allowed to sell tickets to the film.Though it was shot in the ancient Aramaic language (along with Hebrew and Latin) and then subtitled, the film spoke in the only language that Hollywood understands: It cost $30m to make (paid for by Gibson himself, with an additional $15m for marketing) and grossed over $370m in the United States and over $240m in the rest of the world. That’s more than $600m in total. When it was re-cut and briefly re-released the following year, it earned another half million dollars worldwide. Hollywood paid close attention. Now, more than fifteen years later, Mel Gibson is in pre-production on a new film, The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection, dealing with the 72-hour period between the crucifixion and death of Jesus on Good Friday, and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. Gibson will again direct and co-produce for his company, Icon Productions, with his longtime producing partner Bruce Davey, and he’s co-authoring the new screenplay with Randall Wallace, who also wrote Braveheart, Pearl Harbor, and Heaven is For Real. As with the first film, Resurrection will be shot in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew.Jim Caviezel, who starred in the original film as Jesus, will reprise that role. Gibson must have enormous faith in Caviezel’s ability, since at the time the original film was cast, Caviezel was almost exactly Jesus’s age (33) at his death. Now he’s fifty-one, playing the same character in the 72 hours after the end of the last film. Gibson had hinted in a TV interview with Stephen Colbert in 2016 that part of that three-day period might involve Jesus descending to hell and dealing with the demons there.Gibson plans to release the new film on March 31, 2021, in time for Easter next year. No one is sure yet what we’ll see on the screen at that time, but Caviezel apparently took his role as Jesus seriously enough to later take on the role of Gospel writer Luke in the 2018 film Paul, Apostle of Christ. During interviews for Paul, Caviezel said of Resurrection, “There are things that I cannot say… [but] It’s great…I won’t tell you how he’s going to go about it, but I’ll tell you this much, the film he’s going to do is going to be the biggest film in history. It’s that good.”Caviezel probably hopes the next shoot will be less dramatic than his previous shoot as Jesus. During the original Passion shoot, he was struck by lightning twice (during the Sermon on the Mount scene and the Crucifixion scene). He suffered a separated shoulder when the heavy wooden cross fell on him, experienced hypothermia in the cold Italian winter, and still bears a 14-inch scar from the scourging scene when the whip accidentally hit him and tore open his skin. He was also the only American actor in the international cast.Many of the actors in the original film were deeply moved by the experience and chose to convert to Catholicism after the film was finished. Among the actor converts was the atheist who played Judas Iscariot.If the new film is even half as impactful as the last film, Gibson will still have made a significant statement to the world.",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/passion-of-the-christ-sequel-gibson/
156,Commentary,Why Can’t Democrats Just Be Normal? ,"The economy has been shut down. The government has taken on massive new powers. A virus of unknown infectivity and lethality rates is running rampant.Given the extraordinary circumstances, it was hard to imagine anybody could think this was a moment for partisanship.Truly, it was the hope of all patriotic Americans that Democrats could find a way to be normal human beings. At least until the crisis expires and things begin to resemble normalcy.Democrats made sure to obliterate those hopes when they tanked a bipartisan CCP Virus relief bill, and just today nixed the idea of more relief for small businesses because they didn’t get their way on funding for their preferred causes, including mail-in ballots which are susceptible to fraud.Sure, the original bill was far from perfect, and Democrats had plenty to be happy about.That bill was set to give businesses desperately needed liquidity, and give the American people some amount of money to tide them over until the government allows them to work again. At least, that was how normal people saw it.Democrats saw it as a tremendous opportunity to score items on their political wish list.Normally, they wouldn’t have the power to accomplish this in the Senate without the support of Republican defections. But these were unique times. The Republicans were short on votes due to multiple Senators being placed in quarantine. And Democrats pounced.They took advantage of Republican absences, crashing a bipartisan bill seemingly negotiated in good faith.The bill Pelosi proposed to replace it was stuffed with asinine elements of the standard Democrat wish list, including the cancelation of all Post Office debt owed to the Treasury, and new carbon emission standards for airlines.Those might have been the more sane requests. Among the even more deranged asks, were the enforcement of racial quotas in private boardrooms.It was one of the most cynical ploys ever perpetrated by a political party, immoral to the highest degree. A genuinely malevolent attempt to hold struggling Americans hostage until they caved to Democrats’ radical, partisan demands. It was one of the most despicable things we have ever witnessed. And I am so glad that Democrats chose to do it.Because, put simply, Democrats are incapable of being normal. Even in times of crisis.It’s a tempting proposition to think about Democrats stepping up when it really matters. It might seem like a worthy exchange. In the short run, it would help people just a moment sooner. And that’s a good thing. But is it really the most good thing that could possibly happen? What’s the end result of a Democrat pretending they’re a normal human being, when they’re obviously not?The end result of that is Democrats avoiding consequences for their actions. They’ll destroy the country in peace and privacy when the American people have restored their usual blind eye to the circus of congress. When the American public gets back on their feet—because that’s what they do—they’ll go back to ignoring the clowns on Capitol Hill in both parties.As the attention of the people wanes, so too do the political consequences of immoral behavior.Rather than sticking all of their favorite hobby horses in one bill of monumental importance, they’ll sneak those same hobby horses into different and less consequential bills. It will all get done, just a little slower. The damage done wouldn’t be nearly so immediate, but it would add up. Eventually, the accumulated wounds would be just as severe as a single blow.Meanwhile, Democrats realized they don’t yet have the political capital to pull this off.The American people will get their relief, delayed only by a moment. It will include some absurd pork, because that’s the nature of government. But the bulk of their insanity will have been thwarted. And more importantly than just getting most of the government largesse out of the bill? The Democrats told each and every American just who they are.Now, it’s incumbent on all of us to believe them.If someone is going to work against me, I want them to move swiftly and clumsily. I want them to snap branches, and fall over their own shoelaces. The Democrats didn’t work against me in particular, but they worked against the American people. They moved swiftly, and they were as clumsy as is imaginable.In November, there will be a tremendous opportunity to punish these Democrats for their actions. They can be removed from office, and they will no longer be in a position to take such craven approaches. This opportunity wouldn’t have existed if Democrats were capable of just being normal.Lead Image Credit: DonkyHotey (Flickr/CC)",https://thenationalpulse.com/commentary/why-cant-democrats-just-be-normal/
157,Commentary,What’s More Racist: ‘Chinese Virus’ or the CCP’s Colonization of Africa?,"Rep. Judy Chu (D-California) recently told CNN that it is ‘dangerous’ for the President to refer to Covid-19 as the ‘Chinese Virus’.“He is creating more xenophobia every single time he does that. And we can see the results in what’s happening to Asian Americans across the country.”A recent BBC article examined how the ‘virus of prejudice’ is manifesting in the nation of Kenya. It cited several recent examples, such as a viral video of an Asian man and woman being bullied by a large crowd in the capital of Nairobi.The BBC explains such prejudice is rooted in the economic relationship between the two countries: “Kenya has borrowed a large amount of money from China for big infrastructure projects. While the ordinary Kenyan is not feeling the benefit, they are looking for someone to blame for their economic woes”.This interpretation completely misses the forest for the trees.The forest, in this case, is the enduring criticism that China has long been engaging in “new colonialism” with respect to Africa. But isn’t colonialism supposed to be considered racist?The Communist Party of China first began planting its proverbial seeds in Africa shortly after its rise to power in 1949. It lobbied African nations extensively to recognize its government and soon began building infrastructure across the continent in return.The hidden reason for this, according to Forbes, was the power vacuum that remained after Western colonial powers began to wane. The continent “was still the same stockpile of natural resources its always been”, thus China wasted no time in “laying the political and economic inroads” in order to position itself for the future.Ironically, even former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned of this new colonialism of Africa by China.“We saw that during colonial times it is easy to come in, take out natural resources, pay off leaders and leave,” said Clinton in 2011.But what began as political partnerships and infrastructure projects has led to recurring accusations of “debt trap diplomacy”.Essentially, China has become a global creditor, secretly lending to other countries who end up saddled with hidden debt.This can result in being forced to “sign over national territory or make steep concessions if they can’t meet liabilities”.Kenya itself provides a glaring example of debt trap diplomacy. In 2019, it faced pressure to forfeit its “lucrative Port of Mombasa to Chinese companies” as a result of unpaid debt.Perhaps this has something to do with the BBC’s claim that the “ordinary Kenyan” is “looking for someone to blame for their economic woes”. Perhaps any backlash is more of a reflection of China’s exploitation of Kenya than fear of Covid-19?With respect to Kenya, what is more racist: local taxi drivers not picking up Chinese nationals; or, the government of China colonizing Africa?Furthermore, what shows greater prejudice: President Trump acknowledging the outbreak originated in Wuhan, China; or, the government of China suppressing information about the outbreak and jeopardizing the health of people around the world?The media’s overuse of the term ‘racism’ gives the public a distorted view of current events. This can be seen in CNN’s narrative that calling COVID-19 a “Chinese Virus” has catalyzed an uptick in xenophobia against people of Asian descent.What this fails to account for, however, is the Chinese Communist Party’s role in the current pandemic. It did indeed cover up the outbreak at the time of its genesis.As a result, the CCP put billions of people at risk. This includes Asian-Americans. It includes Kenyans. In fact, it includes any combination of intersectional subgroups that one could possibly conceive.Perhaps the Chinese Communist Party should be the one defending itself against allegations of racism.",https://thenationalpulse.com/politics/racist-chinese-virus-ccp-africa/
